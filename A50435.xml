         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>SECT. I. <hi>Of</hi> Fevers <hi>in General.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN the former attempt upon this Subject, I curſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, immethodically, and briefly, toucht upon ſome errours in the <hi>Notion</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers: But ſince conſidering the great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof; the mortal events daily depending thereon, excites me to a farther inquiry, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical digeſtion, for future caution in this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous matter. <hi>Nunquam ſatis dicitur, quod non ſatis diſcitur.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For many lives have been caſt away upon this Rock, both of the <hi>Wiſe</hi> and the <hi>Wealthy,</hi> the <hi>Good</hi> and the <hi>Great, Princes,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of all ſorts, have had their <hi>Fate,</hi> by great miſtakes herein, and evil conduct of the undertakers for their preſervation.</p>
            <p>After the many <hi>Volumes</hi> that have been writ, and ſo much <hi>Paper</hi> waſted upon this ſubject of Fevers: After ſo much <hi>experience</hi> from the <hi>living,</hi> that have evaded this ſickneſs, and the <hi>Millions</hi> of People, that have <hi>died</hi> with Fevers, or in a <hi>febrile</hi> ſtate: I find <hi>Writers</hi> and <hi>Practiſers</hi> in this Art, to have wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred from the right way, in their deſigns and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:33858:4"/>of curing, not truly diſcerning what a <hi>Fever</hi> is, though daily talked on, and practiſed upon.</p>
            <p>Nothing more frequently preſents to <hi>Phyſicians</hi> in Practice than a <hi>Fever: (Comes omnium morborum eſt. Hippoc.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.) And nothing more perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly miſtaken (to the loſs of innumerable Lives) than that which is called a <hi>Fever;</hi> ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> but is none: which <hi>errour</hi> is as old, as the Riſe of Phyſick, yet received for truth at this day; not only by <hi>Profeſſors</hi> of the lower <hi>Claſs,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Phyſicians</hi> of the firſt <hi>Rank,</hi> (truſting to <hi>tradition)</hi> who frequently blunder in proſecuting a <hi>Symptomatic</hi> depending Fever, and <hi>overſee</hi> the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>This is manifeſt from their <hi>Methods,</hi> and <hi>Medicines</hi> in the deſigns and intentions of curing; aiming at, and endeavouring to extinguiſh Fevers, by cooling <hi>Apozems, Juleps, Ptiſans, Emulſions, Phlebotomy:</hi> And a ſtrange invention, to draw out the <hi>Fever</hi> with <hi>(E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſpaſtic)</hi> bliſtering <hi>Plaiſters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All which <hi>projects,</hi> and proceedings in <hi>Practice,</hi> are irrational and erroneous; abſurdly wide from the true Notion of <hi>Fevers,</hi> as hereafter doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>'Tis commonly ſaid (and from the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> mouth) this and that Perſon is <hi>ſick</hi> of a Fever; and ſuch a one <hi>died</hi> of a Fever; both which are great miſtakes.</p>
            <p>True it is, few are <hi>ſick,</hi> and very few, or none <hi>die,</hi> without a Fever; that is a <hi>febrile</hi> heat attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſickneſs, or Death: But this preternatural
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:33858:4"/>
               <hi>Heat,</hi> is not their Diſeaſe; no more than <hi>Thirſt</hi> is their Diſeaſe, or cold <hi>chilneſs,</hi> or loathing of <hi>meat,</hi> or <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>wearineſs, watching,</hi> or <hi>Pain,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But if you will have all theſe preternatural and <hi>ſymptomatical</hi> affects, to be Diſeaſes, and like ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dogs worrying of a Man; you have not a right underſtanding thereof: And deſigning of cures to this, or that Symptom, under the notion of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, your proceedings are ill grounded, and the ſucceſs from thence not hopeful.</p>
            <p>I wonder Phyſicians ſhould be ſo ſhort ſighted, as not to fee beyond the Fever: That they ſhould take a ſymptom for a Diſeaſe, is a great miſtake; and which too often hath proved a mortal errour: For, if the Fever (as ſometimes) be the ſymptom of a dangerous Diſeaſe, 'tis probable the Patient dies by male Practice, the Phyſician directing his cure againſt the Fever, neglecting and not diſcerning, from whence, or what Diſeaſe, the Fever does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on.</p>
            <p>For Fevers (occaſionally procured) are almoſt as many, as there are Diſeaſes: <hi>Colic</hi> Fevers, <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectic</hi> Fevers, <hi>Soporiferous, Pleurific, Malignant, Apoſtematic, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcerous, Traumatic, Verminous,</hi> &amp;c. hundreds: All the <hi>Acute</hi> Diſeaſes, and moſt of the <hi>Chronit,</hi> have Fevers attending, or depending on them.</p>
            <p>In a late Tract <hi>(Inquiries into the general Catalogue of Diſeaſes)</hi> ſhewing the errours of that draught; as to the <hi>Number, Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Denominations</hi> thereof: For ſufficient reaſons, I ſtruck out the firſt Diviſion
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:33858:5"/>(called <hi>Similar</hi> Diſeaſes) of that Catalogue, becauſe the ſuppoſed Diſeaſes contained therein, (upon the <hi>Inqueſt</hi>) were found to be no <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> but <hi>Symptoms</hi> only, and properly belonging to that <hi>Tribe,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Fevers</hi> are alſo contained.</p>
            <p>For, in the number of <hi>Symptoms</hi> (by your own <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors</hi>) I find <hi>Qualities</hi> preternatural: And amongſt them <hi>(intemperies calida)</hi> a hot diſtemper or <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, neceſſarily included: Now <hi>Heat</hi> being an eminent <hi>Quality</hi> in Human Nature, and frequently is changed from its moderate natural ſtate, in moſt <hi>Morbous</hi> alterations; then this <hi>Quality</hi> thus gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally exalted <hi>(idem ſpecie)</hi> is that which you call a Fever.</p>
            <p>Thus changing its denomination; this <hi>Quality</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternaturally graduated, then paſſeth for a <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> (they not knowing, from what Principle it aſſurgeth) and a formidable invader of the Life, requiring all endeavours to oppoſe, and reduce it by the uſe of <hi>contraries,</hi> being ſo taught by a falſe Canon: <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariorum contraria ſunt remedia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is ſo in your <hi>Senſe,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt it, (which is no <hi>ſence</hi>) I ſhall prove from the <hi>Definition</hi> of a <hi>Fever;</hi> and alſo from the <hi>curative</hi> means adapted thereto, in their due places.</p>

            <p>If ſo, then I obſerve, firſt, that a Fever is but a <hi>Symptom,</hi> and not a Diſeaſe; (by your own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine) for they that gave this definition, do alſo determine <hi>Qualities</hi> preternatural to be <hi>Symptoms;</hi> and <hi>Heat,</hi> being one of the tactil Qualities of the firſt rank (by the ſame Authors) can be but a ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom.</p>
            <p>Now preternatural febrile <hi>Heat,</hi> being only a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom,</hi> and none of the urgent Symptoms; there is, (at leaſt there ought) no cure belonging to it; but to that Diſeaſe, on which the febrile <hi>Heat</hi> is depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant; and thoſe Diſeaſes are many, and various: For, methods, and medicines are indicated from the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:33858:6"/>
               <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> not from the <hi>Symptom;</hi> and their adapta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion proper and peculiar, only to the Diſeaſe, not to the <hi>Symptom;</hi> to <hi>cauſes,</hi> not to <hi>conſequents,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants.</p>
            <p>Since it is ſo, why do you create ſuch fears in the Sick, and make ſo much buſtle at the Shops, about this febrile Heat? deſigning multiplicity of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines againſt it (and thoſe very injurious) ſince this feveriſh Heat, being only Symptomatical, gives warning, and is a ſignal only of ſome latent Diſeaſe, the which being found out, curing lies there, and there only; the depending Fever is included therein, and falls of courſe with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In Corde accenſus.</hi>] In the <hi>Heart</hi> (you ſay) a <hi>Fever</hi> is kindled, as the place of its riſe: But I rather think <hi>cujus contrarium,</hi> that a <hi>Fever</hi> is communicated or tranſmitted to the <hi>Heart</hi> from all <hi>Parts</hi> of the Body, at ſeveral times, by ſeveral Diſeaſes: For, if preternatural Heat <hi>(Febris)</hi> be the general, and moſt common <hi>Symptom</hi> of Diſeaſes, cauſed thereby, and depending thereon, riſing and falling with thoſe va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> ſeated in divers Parts of the Body; then all their <hi>Symptomatical</hi> Fevers, muſt have their riſe and ſeat in the ſeveral diſeaſed Parts; and the <hi>Heart</hi> only by conſent, and tranſmiſſion <hi>(per vaſa)</hi> through the veſſels of communication.</p>
            <p>The vital <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of Life, that preſides over, and is planted in every <hi>Part</hi> of the Body, to govern each member; raiſeth a <hi>Fever,</hi> upon any morbific matter there offending; and the <hi>Heart</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a principle <hi>Part</hi> in office, is ſoon made ſenſible, and raiſeth the <hi>Pulſe,</hi> as a ſignal of condolence, if
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:33858:6"/>any diſturbance be in the Body: And ſometimes the <hi>Head</hi> alſo is affected thereby, and drawn into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Foot</hi> be greatly pained by <hi>Gout,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; the <hi>Heart</hi> is grieved, and frebile <hi>Heat</hi> is kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but this <hi>Fever</hi> firſt riſeth in, and is communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated from the diſeaſed Parts (the Foot) primarily affected; and the Heart diſturbed and heated only <hi>(ſecundariò)</hi> by conſent: And the <hi>Fever</hi> thus raiſed, requires curing, not in the <hi>Heart</hi> ſo affected, but in the <hi>Foot</hi> diſeaſed, having its riſe there, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance there, not in the <hi>Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore <hi>Cardiac</hi> medicines, are not <hi>curative</hi> in the caſe, nor conducing; but ſuch means as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the diſeaſed Part firſt complaining; and the cure of this Gout-fever lies there only; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rightly applied to, the <hi>Symptomatic</hi> febrile <hi>Heat</hi> abates and vaniſheth, as the Diſeaſe is tamed and ſubdued. The like may be ſaid, and holds true in all other Fevers, ariſing from ſeveral Parts of the Body diſeaſed.</p>
            <p>But a late famed Author, Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in his Book of <hi>Fevers,</hi> though he agrees with theſe <hi>Writers,</hi> that the <hi>Heart</hi> is the Fire-place, where Fevers are kindled, yet he differs from them in the manner <hi>how,</hi> and the combuſtible matter <hi>what.</hi>

            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:33858:7"/>
            <p>He makes preternatural fermentation to be the <hi>ratio formalis</hi> of Fevers, and proſecutes upon that notion, through the ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and gives this deſcription: <hi>Febris eſt motus inordinatus ſanguinis, ejuſque nimia efferveſcentia, cum calore.</hi> — p. 117. uſing efferveſcence and fermentation as <hi>ſynonumous</hi> and <hi>univocal,</hi> all along.</p>
            <p>True it is; <hi>febrile Heat</hi> ſometimes does follow preternatural <hi>fermentation</hi> (from thence occaſionally procured) yet not always ariſing out of <hi>fermentation,</hi> as the proper and only effect thereof; but iſſuing from the governing vital <hi>Principle,</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> of Life <hi>(fons caloris)</hi> diſturbed and aeſtuating.</p>
            <p>In like manner preternatural fermentation <hi>(motus inordinatus ſanguinis)</hi> is cauſed by <hi>febrile</hi> aeſtuation. They follow one another, and often meet together in ſickneſs, yet are diſtinct, and different from each other.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Fermentation,</hi> differ in Predicament: <hi>fermentatio eſt motus; calor febrilis eſt qualitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vomiting</hi> and <hi>Fever</hi> meet ſometimes, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated.</p>

            <p>So that preternatural <hi>fermentation,</hi> is not inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from <hi>Fevers;</hi> and cannot be ſo eſſential there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,

Lib. de Febribus.</hi> p. 158.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Several other places, I might recite in that <hi>Book;</hi> ſetting forth the <hi>combuſtible</hi> matter of Fevers, and how kindled; which for Brevity ſake I omit, and having enough to diſcourſe on.</p>
            <p>But my <hi>Reaſon</hi> informs me otherwiſe, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines: <hi>Firſt,</hi> that <hi>natural Heat</hi> and <hi>preternatural,</hi> is the ſame <hi>(in ſpecie)</hi> in kind, ariſing from one and the ſame <hi>Principle</hi> or Fountain, and differ <hi>(gradu tantum)</hi> only in moderation and gradual ſtate: <hi>Quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid in ſanis edit actiones ſanas; id ipſum in morbis edit actiones vitiatas. Axiom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore that vital <hi>Spirit,</hi> which heats Man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally in a State of <hi>Health:</hi> The ſame does preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:33858:9"/>aeſtuate, and burn in <hi>Fevers,</hi> being diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed at hoſtile <hi>morbous</hi> matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly, Febrile</hi> Heat does not ariſe, <hi>(à materia ſulphurea, oleaginoſa, combuſtibili)</hi> from any <hi>ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, oleaginous, combuſtible</hi> matter kindled (as that <hi>Author</hi> aſſerts) but from any offending matter (that's the <hi>fomes Morbi,</hi> the <hi>fuel</hi> of Fevers) that provokes and ſtirs up the vital governing <hi>Spirit</hi> to kindle, aeſtuate and become fiery; labouring and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>(niſu quodam irato)</hi> thereby to exterminate and expel it. Fevers are not kindled, nor continued, <hi>à materia flammante;</hi> but <hi>à materia peccunte quacun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que:</hi> A ſtone in the <hi>Kidney,</hi> without the help of <hi>Oleagenous, Sulphureous</hi> combuſtible matter, will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily procure a <hi>Fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Febrile matter remains after the Patient is dead; but febrile Heat is then gone; and why then? Becauſe the vital ſpirit is extinct: which plainly does ſhew, that preternatural febrile Heat <hi>(efficienter)</hi> is ſeated in the Life: And that peccant febrile matter <hi>(non fervet ex ſe)</hi> contains no ſuch heat in it ſelf, but produceth <hi>(excitativè)</hi> by irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the vital Heat <hi>(ſpiritus impetum faciens)</hi> beyond moderation, and its natural temper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> A <hi>wound</hi> received, and pain ariſing thence, begets a <hi>Fever;</hi> though a great effuſion of blood doth happen therewith. Now letting out the <hi>ſulphur</hi> (if ſuch there were) with the <hi>blood,</hi> was more likely to <hi>prevent</hi> a Fever, than to <hi>cauſe</hi> it, (if that Doctrine were true;) but I find the contrary, that <hi>pain</hi> continuing, the <hi>Fever</hi> continues alſo.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:33858:9"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Perſons that are heated by great <hi>labour,</hi> violent <hi>exerciſe,</hi> or heat of weather, if they drink a glaſs of <hi>Sack,</hi> or other <hi>ſpirituous</hi> hot liquor, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth them ſafely to good <hi>temper,</hi> and prevents a <hi>Fever:</hi> But if they drink much ſmall <hi>Beer,</hi> after ſuch heats, thinking to cool themſelves ſooner, that <hi>cold</hi> liquor commonly makes them <hi>ſick,</hi> and raiſeth a <hi>Fever</hi> thereby.</p>
            <p>Now obſerve, that <hi>Sack</hi> and not <hi>ſpirits,</hi> are more likely to kindle <hi>Sulphurous</hi> inflamable matter, and a <hi>Fever</hi> from thence; as ſmall <hi>Beer</hi> and <hi>cool</hi> liquors, moſt likely to prevent <hi>Fevers</hi> (by that Doctrine.) But the contrary hereof does prove, that inflamed <hi>ſulphur</hi> is not the <hi>material</hi> cauſe of Fevers, but any other offending matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly, Wet,</hi> and <hi>cold</hi> taking, are oftentimes the cauſes of ſickneſs, and a Fever: But ſuch cauſes are ſo far from kindling <hi>Sulphur,</hi> that they are more likely to <hi>damp,</hi> and extinguiſh <hi>Sulphur</hi> kindled, if any ſuch inflaming matter were in Human Bodies: All which does plainly ſhew, that <hi>Fevers</hi> have not their <hi>Riſe,</hi> or any <hi>dependance</hi> from <hi>ſulphur</hi> kindled in the <hi>Heart;</hi> and that <hi>Doctrine</hi> erroneous, founded upon falſe <hi>Principles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I muſt now make this obſervation: not to follow an <hi>Author</hi> by the <hi>cry</hi> of the <hi>People.</hi> nor the <hi>Vogue</hi> of the <hi>learned</hi> Party, who commonly are catcht with a fine dreſs of good <hi>latine,</hi> not ſuſpecting, or not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> and matter thereof.</p>
            <p>Since my writing, I lately met with another Piece <hi>de Febribus,</hi> much differing from the former Author,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:33858:10"/>who derived all the cauſes of Fevers, from Sulphur of the Blood; this, only and wholly from a vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Ferment, infeſting the <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits. Dr. <hi>Morton, Puretologia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This novel Doctrine coming in my way, I cannot paſs it by without regard, but muſt inquire into the verity thereof. The common received learning, that aſſerts <hi>Humours</hi> and <hi>Qualities,</hi> this Author re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as fictitious and uſeleſs, to ſet forth and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, the cauſes of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and their Symptoms. Hoping to give a better account thereof, by this new Hypotheſis: For ſetting forth and explaining of which, he premiſeth (<hi>poſtulata quaedam,</hi> Pag. 6.) ſome precarious conceſſions; promiſing to prove them afterwards, which are theſe following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Dari reverà Spiritus animales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Aſſertion of <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon received <hi>Opinion</hi> in former Ages; and does yet keep up as a Truth not to be queſtioned, (in the Judgment of moſt) for that they perform ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary offices in the Body, as without their help many Functions (they think) muſt ceaſe: And in giving an Account of many Diſeaſes; eſpecially ſuch as are attributed to the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> they can give no probable Reaſons, without alledging and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing the <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits; ſetting forth their exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant <hi>Motions,</hi> or preternatural <hi>ceſſations,</hi> their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruptions,</hi> or impetuous <hi>Influx,</hi> their ſluggiſh, dull, and torpid <hi>Fixations:</hi> And ſcarce any Paſſion is named, but the <hi>Spirits</hi> are <hi>Actors,</hi> and by them, All that is done, or ſhould have been, is imputed to the <hi>Spirits.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:33858:10"/>
            <p>And Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> gives a greater Prerogative, and aſcribes more Power to <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Body, than others have; (<hi>primum Principium activum totius Machinae.</hi> p. 6.) and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms his new <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> upon <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, (<hi>quaſi fermentum univerſale totius corporis.</hi> p. 12.) making them univerſal in the cauſes of Diſeaſes, and as ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally neceſſary in a State of <hi>Health,</hi> to perform all vital Actions. If this be ſo, 'tis very fit we ſhould all know, and aſſent to it.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding it is ſo undoubtedly aſſerted; I queſtion whether there be any ſuch diſtinct <hi>Beings</hi> in Human Nature, as <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits; or only the <hi>Fancies</hi> of Mens Invention: And my Reaſon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades me to deny their <hi>Exiſtence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe their <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; their <hi>Ways</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> are ſo uncertainly, and contradictorily ſet forth by diſagreeing Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For that all human Actions, <hi>internal</hi> and <hi>external;</hi> may be performed without their help; and a rational and full Account of all Diſeaſes, may be given without them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Entia non ſunt multiplicanda, ſine Neceſſitate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore divide Human Nature, into theſe two grand Principles.</p>
            <p>An Inviſible <hi>Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:33858:11"/>
            <p>And a viſible <hi>organized</hi> Body; with <hi>canals</hi> contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liquid alimentary <hi>Juices,</hi> to feed and ſupply this wonderful <hi>Machine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt, a Vital, Active, Regent <hi>Principle.</hi> The latter altogether <hi>Paſſive</hi> and <hi>Inſtrumental,</hi> under the Power and Domination of the former, which is the Life.</p>
            <p>More than theſe two comprehenſive <hi>Principles,</hi> I know none; nor can admit of, as neceſſary, or uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the compoſition, or <hi>oeconomy</hi> of Human Nature: No Subordinate, nor Co-ordinate Agents; ſuch as, <hi>Archeus Helmontii,</hi> or <hi>Anima Senſitiva</hi> of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients:</hi> Nor as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> underſtands and holds, the Animal Spirits to be the Senſitive Soul.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Plaſtic,</hi> or formative vital <hi>Principle</hi> (term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Anima</hi>) that delineated, and fabricated the Body in the <hi>Womb;</hi> does alſo govern, and is the ſole <hi>Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> cauſe of vital Actions, in the ſtate of Health; and alſo in Sickneſs: <hi>

            <p>True it is; that the contained current liquors in the Body, are various in <hi>colour, conſiſtence, uſe,</hi> and gradual Perfection: Some elaborated as <hi>finer,</hi> and more <hi>ſpirituous;</hi> in the common Sence and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, of artificial rectified Spirits: Yet when all this is done, by Defaecation and refining; they are but <hi>liquors</hi> ſtill; of one continued, cohaerent, viſible,

            <p>Now if what we have ſaid be true, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cogent; then <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> have no Reſidence nor Office in Human Nature; and the <hi>Baſis</hi> of that Author's new <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> is annihilated; and all the derived Doctrine, and depending Practice thereupon, comes to nothing or to naught.</p>
            <p>But in caſting off ſo antique, and beloved Opinion; ſo frequently made uſe on, to ſet forth the <hi>cauſes</hi> of many <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> and that Book <hi>de Morbis univerſal. acutis,</hi> brings in <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits invenom'd, almoſt into all Diſeaſes, as <hi>principal</hi> Cauſes: That I may not be thought ſingular, and abſurd in denying the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of theſe <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, ſo poſitively aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſo much noted, and often quoted: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call in ſome other Men, eminently learned in this Science, and juſtly ſo reputed; to give their ſentiments upon this matter controverted; which perhaps may be more perſwaſive, and definitive, than what hath been ſaid by me.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Charlton,</hi> in his Enquiries into Human Nature; there treating of Motion voluntary, and how per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Animal Spirits, according to the Opinion of the Ancients: He ſaith, <hi>Page</hi> 495.
<q>But in this our more illuminate Age, Fate hath brought forth ſome Phyſicians of this Nation and Colledge, of moſt profound Learning, and admirable Sagacity of Spirit; who laying aſide that ſo antique Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis

            <p>To eſtabliſh the verity of <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, and to perſwade a belief thereof: This learned Author tells us; that the <hi>Exiſtence</hi> of <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, may be proved with as much Demonſtration, and a like Reaſon, as the <hi>Soul</hi> it ſelf: Becauſe they are both
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:33858:13"/>known, only by their <hi>effects,</hi> and not <hi>à priori.</hi>

            <p>I beg his pardon, and muſt deny that equality of Proof, for <hi>Reaſons</hi> following.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a Neceſſity of allowing and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Architectonic</hi> Spirit, the vital <hi>Principle Anima,</hi> that formed the <hi>Machine</hi> of Human Body; and is Supreme <hi>Moderator</hi> in the Government. The <hi>Specific</hi> Form is not to be queſtioned, or doubted, in every Creature, but that there is ſuch, which gives the <hi>Being,</hi> and the Diſtinction from others; only the <hi>quiddity</hi> and <hi>quality</hi> thereof, may be doubted, and controverted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> None have denied, nor ſo much as doubted of the <hi>Souls</hi> Exiſtence, the Heathen <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers</hi> not excepted; but they have denied <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits, from the difficulty of Admittance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is a great Diſproportion, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of Proof; between a Thing that <hi>muſt</hi> be, and can by no Reaſon be denied, but aſſented to by All; And a Thing <hi>dubious</hi> that <hi>may</hi> not be; that by many is denied to be from valid Reaſons: where there is no Neceſſity for the uſe of it; and where is great Difficulty and Diſcord of Opinions in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Reality and Certainty thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Effects</hi> of the one, are ſo manifeſt, as altogether undeniable: But the reputed and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:33858:13"/>Effects of the other; are ſo dubitable, diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and improbable; that many learned Men of the higheſt Rank, do not own ſuch Effects, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits; but have aſſigned other cauſes to produce thoſe Effects. Wherefore, <hi>Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of <hi>Proof,</hi> does not, and cannot poſſibly ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
            <p>Here we might end; as not expecting to gain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of <hi>Fevers,</hi> by farther Diſquiſition here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſince this firſt <hi>Poſition,</hi> being the <hi>Baſis</hi> of the whole work; is but an <hi>imaginary,</hi> and <hi>erroneous</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition: Yet for Diſcourſe ſake, and to obſerve the Novelties dependant upon theſe Suppoſed <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal</hi> Spirits, we will proceed a little farther, and take notice of ſome remarkables.</p>

            <p>The learned Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi> finding ſo many Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and Diſſention of Opinions concerning the <hi>Matter, Generation,</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> of Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſaith:
<q>Equally uncertain it is, by what kind of Motion theſe inviſible <hi>Emiſſaries</hi> are tranſmitted from the Brain through the <hi>Nerves;</hi> whether they fly ſwiftly, or creep along ſlowly.

            <p>In the next <hi>Page,</hi> he brings in another Diſſenter herein; whom he admires and applauds for his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity and profound Judgment.
<q>No wonder then if Dr. <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> plainly diſcerning the <hi>Incongruity,</hi> of this moſt rapid and recriprocal Motion, attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:33858:15"/>to the Animal Spirits; not only wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected it, but excogitated another plainly <hi>contrary</hi> thereto. For he concludes, that the Spirits lodged in the <hi>Succus nutritius,</hi> are carried from the <hi>Brain</hi> through the <hi>Nerves,</hi> by a Motion not impetuous, or rapid; but <hi>gentle, ſlow,</hi> and <hi>placid,</hi> — As the Juice of Plants is believed to creep up from the Roots, along by their Fibres—</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Notion that Dr. <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi> had of Animal Spirits; is far different from what our Author of <hi>Puretologia</hi> affirms them to be: For they do not allow of <hi>Subtility, Volatility,</hi> and <hi>Velo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> of Animal Spirits, for many perſwaſive Reaſons; ſhewing the Inconvenience, and Improbability there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And therefore in Page 504. Dr. <hi>Charleton</hi> ſaith.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But theſe and other Reaſons, induced our moſt excellent Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi> (<hi>de Ventric.</hi> and <hi>Inteſtin. cap.</hi> 8. <hi>num.</hi> 7.) to form his Animal Spirits of a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution exempt from all theſe inconvenient Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.

            <p>
               <hi>Febris eſt calor preternaturalis.</hi> So far I agree; from the etymon of the word, <hi>Febris à ferbee vel ferveo.</hi> But I cannot aſſent to what immediately follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"In Sanguine accenſus à Spiritu animali.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets a <hi>Diſſertation;</hi> and I cannot allow <hi>febrile</hi> Heat to ariſe from the <hi>Animal Spirits.</hi> For; firſt you muſt prove, the <hi>Animal Spirits</hi> to be <hi>(fons caloris)</hi> the Origine of <hi>Heat</hi> in Human Nature. Or Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:33858:17"/>you muſt prove <hi>febrile Heat,</hi> to be ſo diſtinct, and differing from <hi>natural Heat;</hi> as ariſing from two ſeveral different Principles.</p>
            <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> is not probable, or rational: Becauſe <hi>Chylification</hi> and <hi>Sanguification,</hi> precedes, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before the Production of <hi>Animal</hi> Spirits (by the Aſſertors of animal Spirits) and thoſe Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are not performed without <hi>vital</hi> Heat, iſſuing from the vital <hi>Principle;</hi> and there can be no other rationally aſſigned.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> as improbable and difficult to be proved: For, the <hi>Heat</hi> of animal Spirits, is but <hi>mutuatitious</hi> (at beſt) borrowed, dependant, and ſupported by <hi>vital</hi> Heat; and not ariſing from an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant</hi> Principle. This <hi>preternatural</hi> Heat, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to animal Spirit; is the ſame in <hi>Specie,</hi> with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Heat; and they differ only in <hi>gradu;</hi> Febrile Heat aſſuring from the ſame Principle, as natural Heat.</p>
            <p>But why <hi>in Sanguine accenſus,</hi> and no where elſe?</p>
            <p>As if the Blood were the <hi>firſt,</hi> and the <hi>only</hi> Place, where <hi>Fevers</hi> do begin, and have their Reſidence: which Doctrine I cannot comply with, and muſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Fevers,</hi> being only the preternatural Heat of the <hi>Life</hi> incenſed, and <hi>Symptomatical</hi> only: <hi>what</hi> ever the Morbifick cauſe be; and <hi>whereſoever</hi> it be, in any Part of the Body; there the <hi>Fever</hi> begins, and from thence it is continued, until the <hi>Morbous</hi> Matter be removed, or much abated. For, no Part
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:33858:18"/>of the Body is injured, but the <hi>Life</hi> (being <hi>ubiquitary</hi> in the <hi>Microcoſm</hi>) is <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſible of the Hurt, and is diſturb'd thereby; grows <hi>angry, hot</hi> and <hi>fiery; (niſu quodam irato)</hi> endeavouring thereby, to extri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and free her ſelf from the miſchief.</p>

            <p>Here is an <hi>imaginary</hi> venom; ſeizing and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>imagined,</hi> and <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> animal Spirits; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reſult, or conjunction of theſe two dubious and difficult conceptions to be proved: The Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Fevers</hi> is founded; and a <hi>general Practice</hi> conform to theſe <hi>Notions,</hi> is regulated thereby. But I ſhould be loth to venture my Life, or the Lives of others, upon ſuch <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncertainties</hi> and <hi>Improbabilities,</hi> for the Rule of Curing. To ſhew therefore the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſiveneſs, and unfitneſs thereof, to govern and direct the general Practice of <hi>Fevers;</hi> I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:33858:18"/>ſome caſes of <hi>acute Fevers,</hi> that we may ſee how theſe <hi>Poſitions</hi> do prompt and indicate proper Means, and ſutable Methods of Cure: And from thence we may rationally conclude, the <hi>Verity,</hi> or <hi>Errour</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
            <p>A Perſon that hath eat and drank too much; the night following, is very reſtleſs; next morning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of fulneſs, and loathing of any Food; is very Fevoriſh, hot and burning.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Fever</hi> now preſents plainly; but what is to be done in the caſe for Remedy? By the Doctrine afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, the <hi>animal Spirits</hi> are <hi>invenomed,</hi> and the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt be Cured with <hi>Alexipharmacal</hi> Antidotes, to expel the Poiſon, that cauſeth this Fever: Such as the <hi>Jeſuits Powder,</hi> that hath no manifeſt opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but an <hi>occult</hi> vertue to reſiſt <hi>venemous</hi> Matter. And this is the <hi>Febrifuge</hi> ſo much magnified, and uſed by Dr. <hi>Morton,</hi> as excelling all others.</p>
            <p>But my Judgment leads me another way in this caſe: Here is an oppreſſion from Meat and Drink loading the <hi>Stomach,</hi> not being digeſted and duly ſent away. Now what does this caſe <hi>indicate?</hi> but only a <hi>diſcharge</hi> of the matter offending, either <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> or <hi>downwards,</hi> by Medicine of Such Operation.</p>
            <p>The Fever is <hi>plainly</hi> perceived; and the cauſe as <hi>eaſily</hi> underſtood: But where the <hi>venom</hi> afflicting the <hi>animal</hi> Spirits in this <hi>Fever</hi> will be found, I know not; nor do I think there is any ſuch.</p>
            <p>Another is afflicted with the <hi>Colic,</hi> by great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Pain from <hi>Obſtruction,</hi> or acrid lancinating
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:33858:19"/>humoral Matter in the <hi>Colon:</hi> Theſe Pains being violent and continued; prevents ſleep, and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably raiſeth a <hi>Fever.</hi> The vital Regent <hi>Principle</hi> being moleſted and provok'd hereby; then aeſtuats with Inquietude, and grows hot with Indignation, being diſturb'd in Government.</p>
            <p>Now what <hi>manner</hi> of Cure is here required for this <hi>Fever?</hi> But only ſome good <hi>Aperitive,</hi> and <hi>Abſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> Medicine, to open, cleanſe and free the <hi>Guts,</hi> from all degenerate, obſtructing, flatulent <hi>Matter,</hi> that cauſes theſe <hi>Pains;</hi> Which being well perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a true <hi>Purgative</hi> (and not of the common <hi>viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> ſort) the <hi>Pains</hi> ceaſeth; and the <hi>Fever</hi> is gone; becauſe the <hi>Life</hi> is then pacified, at Eaſe and Reſt, cool and temperate; the offending Cauſe being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</p>
            <p>What Occaſion, or what need was here for a <hi>Febrifuge?</hi> But only what was <hi>Curative</hi> as aforeſaid; for removing the Cauſe aforeſaid. The <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der would contribute nothing to this Cure, (ſo much admired and uſed by ſome) I rather think it might do <hi>Hurt</hi> in this Fever; as the medicine by its nature does Suggeſt, which we ſhall enquire into anon. No <hi>Venom</hi> I can diſcover in this caſe, requiring ſuch an Antidote.</p>
            <p>Pains of the <hi>Gout,</hi> or from the <hi>Stone,</hi> raiſeth a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, (for the Reaſons aforeſaid) being the common Symptom attendant upon all <hi>dolorous</hi> Diſeaſes, that diſquiet and incenſe the <hi>Life.</hi> Here is no need of a <hi>Febrifuge</hi> in theſe Fevers; but only ſuch proper Means, as theſe Diſeaſes require. The <hi>febrile</hi> Heat goes off, or abates; as the Diſeaſes yield to the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:33858:19"/>Power of Medicine. <hi>Symptoms</hi> come and go with their Diſeaſes, on which they depend; and <hi>febrile</hi> Heat is only <hi>Symptomatical,</hi> as before proved.</p>
            <p>Here we might enumerate, and run over many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending Fevers; where no ſuch <hi>Poyſon</hi> is to be found: But theſe may ſuffice to inform; that <hi>acute Fevers</hi> are not ſo <hi>venomous</hi> in their nature generally, as the <hi>Definition</hi> of Fevers recited, would have us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. <hi>Genus praedicatur de omnibus Speciebus ſub ſe contentis. Ax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now let us underſtand (if it can be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood) what this <hi>Venom</hi> is, that our <hi>Author</hi> aſſigns to be the material Cauſe of <hi>Fevers,</hi> and of moſt other Diſeaſes; that is ſo frequent and common; and requires Curing by <hi>Alexipharmacals.</hi> The Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Aſſertor of this <hi>Novel;</hi> probably can give us the beſt Account, who defines Poyſon thus.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Ephemeral, Humoral,</hi> and <hi>Hectic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Famoſa &amp; Vulgatiſſima eſt Febris eſſentialis differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia; qua Febris in Ephimeram, Humoralem, &amp; Hecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam, dividitur: quae tota à ſubjecto Febrium petitur, Troph. Serrier Pyretolog.</hi> p. 13.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephemeral</hi> Fever, is an efferveſcence of the <hi>Spirits</hi> only; and continues but a day, or two.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Humoral,</hi> is the eſſerveſcence of putrid <hi>humors;</hi> and continues a longer time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hectic,</hi> is a preternatural Heat in the <hi>Solid</hi> parts; and is moſt durable, and fixed.</p>
            <p>All theſe <hi>Fevers</hi> muſt take their riſe in the <hi>Heart,</hi> (by the common definition) that's the <hi>Center;</hi> and
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:33858:21"/>
               <hi>Seat</hi> thereof. You have brought all Fevers into a little compaſs (the <hi>Heart</hi>) where we may ſoon find them, if they were there to be found: And if all this were true; what advantage, and what uſe can we make of it? What cunning ways will you invent, to make your <hi>Practice</hi> anſwer this <hi>Doctrine?</hi> and how will you make this <hi>Doctrine</hi> ſerviceable in <hi>Practice?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Celebrious <hi>Diviſion</hi> is eſſential, general and comprehenſive: But <hi>(quid inde boni?)</hi> what ſhall we learn thereby?</p>
            <p>If you come to a <hi>Patient,</hi> whoſe <hi>Fever</hi> is begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; and the Fever is one of theſe three <hi>Sorts,</hi> compriſed in the general <hi>Diviſion:</hi> you have no help by this <hi>Doctrine</hi> (if it were true) no informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to determine what; or proſecute with what.</p>
            <p>You cannot ask the <hi>Patient,</hi> how are the <hi>Spirits</hi> of your Heart? How the <hi>Humors?</hi> And how the <hi>Fleſh?</hi> but you muſt look off the <hi>Heart,</hi> and caſt about ſomewhere elſe; inquiring here, and there: How is your <hi>Stomach?</hi> have you good <hi>Appetite,</hi> and digeſt well? are you <hi>Coſtive?</hi> how is your <hi>Head?</hi> do you <hi>urine</hi> freely? have you <hi>pain</hi> any where? and ſo forth —</p>
            <p>After all theſe and ſuch like neceſſary <hi>Queſtions;</hi> 'tis very probable, you may find out the <hi>place</hi> where the Fever is bred, and what is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> thereof: If ſo, as true it is; what then have we to do with the <hi>Heart;</hi> but only to examine by the <hi>Pulſe;</hi> how affected, or afflicted in the caſe; what conſent from thence, or condolence; what vital <hi>Signals</hi> by that Pulſation; not what <hi>Sort</hi> of Fever.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:33858:22"/>
            <p>Now after all the ſubtle and nice diſtinction of <hi>Ephemeral, Humoral,</hi> and <hi>Hectic;</hi> we muſt examine moſt Parts of the Body (the principle at leaſt) to find out the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Seat</hi> of the Fever; and then it will appear to be; not <hi>in Corde primò accenſa,</hi> (as you ſay) but <hi>in Corde per conſenſum;</hi> and that ſome other <hi>Part,</hi> is the original cauſe of the <hi>Fever,</hi> where the Cure is to be directed.</p>
            <p>If there muſt be a place, or places in the Body, aſſigned for Fevers, as the <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Seat</hi> thereof: And ſince they are all <hi>Symptomatical</hi> and dependant upon various Diſeaſes in divers Parts of the Body, as their cauſes occaſional; <hi>(Sedes Morbi, eſt Sedes Febris)</hi> then where the Diſeaſe is, there is the <hi>Seat</hi> of Fevers; So that the difference of Fevers from thence, will not be <hi>triplex,</hi> (according to this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique approved Diviſion) but <hi>multiplex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I wiſh you good Succeſs with your Doctrine of Fevers; but I ſhould be loth to be a Patient under it; leaſt the firſt tryal of your Skill upon me, ſhould be the laſt <hi>Scene</hi> of my Life.</p>
            <p>There is another received diſtinction of Fevers; into <hi>Eſſential,</hi> and <hi>Symptomatical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this I muſt take notice of; becauſe it byaſſeth Practiſers from the right Notion of Fevers; and cauſeth errour in the deſigns of Curing. For this Diſtinction may well be ſet aſide; when as there is no Fever <hi>eſſential</hi> (therefore no Diſeaſe) but all are <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomatical;</hi> ariſing from and dependant upon ſome
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:33858:22"/>
               <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> morbific <hi>Miaſm</hi> or <hi>Seminary,</hi> and a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom thereof.</p>
            <p>And this appears from the Definition of Fevers; <hi>(Febris eſt calor preter naturam—)</hi> preternatural <hi>Heat</hi> being the genus; compriſing all Fevers under it: And this Heat, (by your Doctrine) a Symptomatical <hi>Quality</hi> only: The diſtinction then of <hi>Eſſential</hi> and <hi>Symptomatical</hi> Fevers, is void; unleſs you will hold a contradiction, in your own learning.</p>
            <p>But why ſome <hi>Eſſential,</hi> others <hi>Symptomatical? Riverius</hi> gives this account: <hi>eſſentiales dicuntur; quando putredo in venis communibus, &amp; extra partes privatas accenditur. Symptomaticae verò, quando in parte peculiari inflammata, putredo aut ſuppuratio fit: a qua ob vaſorum communionem vapor putridus cordi continuo communicari poteſt; — lib. de febr.</hi> p. 373.</p>
            <p>They that will take this for good <hi>Reaſon,</hi> may be ſo ſatisfied; and probably they may not ſee the <hi>Definition</hi> of Fever therein contradicted: <hi>(Calor in Corde accenſus, &amp; ex eo —)</hi> and the Doctrine diſcordant in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Another Diſtinction of Fevers there is; which divides them into <hi>Continual</hi> and Intermitting.</p>
            <p>This difference is apparent to vulgar underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; but the manner <hi>how;</hi> the matter <hi>what;</hi> the place <hi>where</hi> generated; cauſes <hi>occaſioning</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting: Theſe are not ſo well known; which hath produced <hi>diverſity</hi> of opinions among the learned: and theſe I ſhall take notice of in their due places.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:33858:23"/>
            <p>Continual Fevers are diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Putrid,</hi> and <hi>Imputrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Intermitting Fevers, are all adjudged <hi>Putrid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some have made this general Diviſion of Fevers; into <hi>Simple, Putrid,</hi> and <hi>Peſtilential.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are alſo Diſtinctions of Fevers, termed <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental</hi> differences; and theſe <hi>Fevers</hi> are called by their Names: (which ſerves only to confound young Practiſers and amuſe the people) thereby making Fevers more perplext, and difficult to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, by additional <hi>cognominations,</hi> from complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Symptoms.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Epiala, Lipiria, Cauſus, Syncopalis, Soporiferae, Aſſodes, Elodes, Tiphodes, Phlegmonòdes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fever by <hi>Denomination;</hi> and different Fevers by <hi>Cognomination</hi> is ſtrange Doctrine: Thus compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Symptoms,</hi> is the confounding of <hi>Reaſon</hi> in Practice.</p>
            <p>Since all <hi>Fevers,</hi> or <hi>febrile</hi> intemperature, is only the aeſtuation, and diſturbance of the vital govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Spirit;</hi> by provocation from ſome <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> or <hi>Morbific</hi> Cauſe; producing various <hi>Symptoms</hi> in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parts of the Body: Tacking ſuch <hi>Symptoms</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by <hi>Cognomination;</hi> that have no dependance upon each other in cauſation, or exiſtence; is no good faſhion, nor good reaſon.</p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:33858:23"/>
            <p>At this rate of <hi>diverſifying</hi> and <hi>denominating</hi> of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, by coupling them with <hi>Symptoms,</hi> and <hi>Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> you may make five hundred <hi>ſorts</hi> more of Fevers, and draw all the practice of <hi>Phyſick</hi> upon Fevers: <hi>Pluriſie</hi> fevers, <hi>Stone</hi> fevers, <hi>Colic</hi> fevers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All the <hi>Acute,</hi> and moſt of the <hi>Chronic</hi> Diſeaſes, have Fevers adjoined.</p>
            <p>The Practice of <hi>Fevers</hi> after this manner; may be as large, as the Practice of <hi>Phyſick:</hi> And by this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of Fevers in <hi>Maſquerade;</hi> from <hi>Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with other <hi>Symptoms,</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Fevers will ſtretch <hi>in infinitum;</hi> not to be comprehended by human underſtanding.</p>
            <p>They might have put in <hi>Camp</hi> Fevers, and <hi>Fleet</hi> Fevers for variety, among the reſt: But if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand Fevers no better, than what your <hi>Books</hi> and <hi>Tradition</hi> does inform; <hi>Princes</hi> are like to have but a melancholy return of their brave <hi>Souldiers</hi> and <hi>Seamen;</hi> as too oft it falls out ſo.</p>
            <p>And here I might give you a ſad Account of <hi>Men,</hi> and <hi>Money</hi> loſt after this manner; by the <hi>formality</hi> of Phyſick, and <hi>deficiency</hi> of the <hi>Profeſſors:</hi> But I troubled my ſelf once before in this matter; and I ſhall trouble my ſelf no more; But this <hi>obiter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If all other <hi>Symptoms</hi> and <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> were to have various names affixed to them, from the diverſity of <hi>Symptoms</hi> happening contemporary; from <hi>Complica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with other Diſeaſes: They might alſo be varied abundantly, (to no purpoſe) by differing adjunct <hi>Titles,</hi> as properly as <hi>Fevers</hi> are thus multifariouſly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:33858:24"/>diſtinguiſhed and denominated; wherein there is no reaſon, nor advantage for Curing.</p>
            <p>

            <head>SECT. IV. <hi>Of Putrid Fevers.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEfore I ſet down the <hi>difference</hi> and <hi>diſtinctions</hi> of <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers, delivered to us by Authors, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and Modern; I think it neceſſary, firſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the word <hi>Putrid:</hi> that we may know what is meant by <hi>Putrefaction,</hi> and <hi>putrifying</hi> in their ſenſe; that firſt taught; and thoſe who now ſupport the Doctrine of <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers: whether they be all of a mind; and what confidence we may have in this learning, upon their diſſent; or to whom we may adhere.</p>
            <p>In determining of <hi>putrefaction,</hi> I find there are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of opinions, and from thence ſeveral <hi>Defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Galen</hi>'s definition ſeems to agree with <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s: And (for brevity ſake) I ſhall only give you the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation and ſenſe of both theſe great Men; well done by another Author in theſe words. <hi>Putrefactio nihil aliud eſt, quam corruptio caloris nativi, in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mido radicali exiſtentis alicuius mixti corporis, facta ab externo &amp; peregrino calore. Kercherus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein external peregrine <hi>Heat,</hi> is made the agreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and invader of the Life of every mixt Body:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:33858:25"/>That natural <hi>Heat</hi> is ſet upon and deſtroyed, and conſequently radical moiſture is conſumed.</p>
            <p>This is the ſenſe and meaning of the celebrated Definitions of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen;</hi> wherein there are theſe great miſtakes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Calor innatus</hi> and <hi>Humidum radicale</hi> are ſuppoſed and made ſubſtantial Principles in nature; when <hi>(re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verà)</hi> they are but <hi>Qualities</hi> aſſurging from their Principles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are made the ſupport of every <hi>Animal;</hi> and to theſe they have attributed too great a ſhare in mixt Bodies; as if the Being thereof depended eſſentially thereupon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>innate Heat,</hi> is ſeated in <hi>radical moiſture;</hi> where putrefaction and corruption begins; and that the Life of an <hi>Animal</hi> conſiſts in theſe two: That they are <hi>Animae domicilium;</hi> the which failing, Life departs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Hence it is that <hi>Putrefaction</hi> is defined, by the alteration, and perdition of theſe two <hi>Principles</hi> in Nature, which <hi>Galen</hi> often calls, <hi>totam rei ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine of Phyſick fails much from theſe grand errours; which biaſſeth Practiſers in the Cure of many Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>For <hi>Putrefaction</hi> is cauſed, not only by external ambient <hi>Heat;</hi> but alſo by external <hi>Cold:</hi> And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the caſe of <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers; cohibited
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:33858:25"/>tranſpiration by <hi>cold</hi> occluding the Pores; is one chief cauſe aſſigned by moſt, if not all Writers. And likewiſe we find that other Animals, and alſo Plants, are mortified by extreme cold, which their natures could not bear; and from thence you need not doubt but Putrefaction follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Putredo,</hi> Putrefaction is not rightly defined by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of Qualities, <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Moiſture;</hi> that may, or may not be; and are accidents, not eſſential to Putrefaction: For <hi>Dry,</hi> and <hi>Cold</hi> Bodies are ſubject to putrifie; as <hi>Bones, Straw, Wood,</hi> &amp;c. wherein is no ſenſible <hi>Heat</hi> or <hi>Moiſture;</hi> and do putrifie into dry powder.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Heat</hi> and <hi>Cold;</hi> and I may add the other two firſt Qualities alſo, <hi>Wet</hi> and <hi>Dry;</hi> though they may be <hi>cauſes</hi> of putrefaction ſometimes; and ſometimes the <hi>effects</hi> thereof; yet they are not ſufficient, to ſet forth and illuſtrate Putrefaction, as the <hi>ratio for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malis</hi> thereof; and a reſult differing from all other preternatural alterations and tranſmutations. Nor does this <hi>Definition,</hi> make diſtinction between pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction, and combuſtion <hi>(à calore externo):</hi> nor ſufficiently extinguiſheth putrefaction from fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>And thus much concerning putrefaction in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, from the two celebrated Definitions of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Galen:</hi> if you be ſatisfied therein, I am not, They ſound great in the <hi>Greek;</hi> but ſignifie little in <hi>Engliſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might write the <hi>Definitions</hi> of many others; <hi>Zeigler, Capivactius, Kyperus,</hi> &amp;c. The examining
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:33858:26"/>and comparing whereof, would give more trouble than ſatisfaction: And therefore to draw home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and come to the buſineſs intended; putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in Fevers particularly; wherein alſo we ſhall find Authors much diſſenting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riverius</hi> a noted <hi>French</hi> Author, much conſulted with, and followed in his methods; becauſe abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with variety of Medicines; taken up upon truſt from other Writers. We will inquire into his <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xis</hi> of Fevers, and ſee what he grounds himſelf upon, in deſigning the Cures of Putrid Fevers.</p>
            <p>He makes all putrid <hi>Fevers</hi> to ariſe, and have their difference from the four Humors in the Maſs of <hi>Bloud;</hi> according to the old <hi>Galenic</hi> doctrine. The more temperate part, called <hi>Blood</hi> ſpecially and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: The hotter part, <hi>Choller:</hi> The crude and colder part, <hi>Phlegm;</hi> The groſſer and more faecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, <hi>Melancholy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When any of theſe four parts of the <hi>Blood</hi> do abound and putrifie; then a putrid <hi>Fever</hi> ariſeth and particularly denominated; as <hi>Sanguinious, Bilious,</hi> &amp;c. putrid Fever.</p>
            <p>And if theſe <hi>Humors</hi> putrifie <hi>(in majoribus vaſis)</hi> in the great Veins and Arteries; then putrid Fevers <hi>Continual</hi> are generated: But if <hi>(in prima corporis Regione)</hi> in the firſt Region; then <hi>Intermitting</hi> Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers (in Engliſh, <hi>Agues</hi>) are produced.</p>
            <p>The putrid <hi>Continual,</hi> are diſtinguiſhed by their exacerbations; into <hi>Quotidian, Tertian,</hi> and <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan:</hi>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:33858:26"/>And putrid <hi>Intermitting</hi> Fevers, <hi>Quotidian, Tertian,</hi> and <hi>Quartan;</hi> by their paroxiſms.</p>
            <p>I might give you ſome more diſtinctions; but here's enough: For they all refer to, and reſt upon the word <hi>putrefaction,</hi> of which we have only a bare <hi>name;</hi> but the ſenſe and true meaning thereof, is yet obſcure and dubious: And after ſo much nice diſtinguiſhing, and dividing of putrid Fevers, by putrefaction of different humors; and by difference of <hi>place</hi> or <hi>ſeat</hi> thereof; yet put refaction in the true notion of it, is not ſet forth; (by this <hi>Author</hi>) and diſtinguiſhed from other degenerate alterations.</p>
            <p>After all this formality, diſtinctions, and diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers; they reſt upon an imaginary foundation, which wants good proof to ſecure and eſtabliſh the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>For Firſt; The Maſs of Blood ſuppoſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of four different Humors, <hi>Blood, Phlegm, Choler</hi> and <hi>Melancholy;</hi> is an antiquated opinion, now exploded by the beſt Modern Writers; that I need not trouble the Reader with more Arguments againſt it.</p>

            <p>Secondly; The forenamed Author though he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds ſo nicely and poſitively, upon the diverſity of <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers; yet hath not ſet down putrefaction in fevers, how it is performed; nor <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> what it is in the reſult: But depends upon <hi>Galens</hi> definition of <hi>putredo</hi> in general; which declares it to be cauſed, <hi>(à calore alieno ambiente)</hi> from external <hi>Heat;</hi> and this is contradicted in the chief cauſe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for producing putrid Fevers, by this, and moſt Writers: <hi>viz.</hi> that they ariſe <hi>(à calore non expirante)</hi> from <hi>tranſpiration</hi> reſtrained; the which frequently is impeded <hi>à frigore externo.</hi>

            <p>I muſt inquire farther for ſatisfaction in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and conſult another Author, elaborately treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon this ſubject, but otherwiſe bottomed in his learning.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> ſetting forth the Anatomy of the <hi>Blood;</hi> thereby ſhewing what parts it is compoſed; he makes the analyſis thereof into theſe five principles: <hi>Spirit, Water, Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:33858:27"/>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Inſunt igitur ſanguine, veluti liquoribus quibuſcun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ad fermentecendum aptis; plurimum Aquae &amp; Spiritus, modicum ſalis &amp; ſulphuris, &amp; aliquantulum terrae. D. Willis, lib. de Febr.</hi> p. 100.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe <hi>principles</hi> his Doctrine of <hi>Fevers</hi> is founded; making all febrile alterations, and effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency of the <hi>Blood,</hi> to depend upon the different exaltations, depreſſions, and combinations of theſe Principles.</p>
            <p>As touching the matter now in hand; and ſhewing how putrid <hi>Fevers</hi> do ariſe, he ſaith:
<q>
                  <hi>Cum pars ſanguinis oleoſa ſive ſulphurea, nimis excalefacta, ſupra modum turgeſcit, ac veluti in flammam adigitur; ideoque à ſimilitudine qua humida putreſcentia fervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem concipiunt, hujuſmodi ſanguinis ebullitio, quia ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorem immodicum inducit, Febris putrida appellatur.</hi> p. 164.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That theſe five parts (called <hi>principles</hi>) may be produced out of <hi>Blood</hi> by a Chymical Analyſis, I doubt not: But that all theſe were pre-exiſting in the Blood, and diſtinct in form, to exerciſe their power, for producing various febrile mutations, by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altations, and domination over each other by turns; is a Doctrine that I muſt deny.</p>
            <p>For it is queſtioned, and not yet proved; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the fire be a true divider and ſeparator of the parts of mixt Bodies; ſince all the tranſmutations that are made by fire upon Bodies; and the diverſity of ſeparated parts from thence, are not the natural conſtituent parts of the mixt, but products of the fire.</p>
            <pb n="46" facs="tcp:33858:28"/>
            <p>To wave the proſecution of theſe Principles, as they are aſſerted the Elements of all natural things, (which would be long and tedious) and to bring them down to our preſent purpoſe; examining how far they do declare the nature of Fevers, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly now that of putrid Fevers.</p>
            <p>Here are <hi>two</hi> things to be inquired: <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be ſuch an Oleaginous inflammable <hi>Sulphur</hi> in the blood, as this Author affirms: And whether the Heat and Ebullition of the Blood, does ariſe from this <hi>Sulphur</hi> inflamed, cauſing a putrid Fever.</p>
            <p>Upon the opening of a Vein, and the <hi>Blood</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a while; there may be ſometimes (not often) a greaſy Scum, or Oilineſs floating a top, ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the other parts, and appearing uppermoſt: But granting this, what does it prove? Nothing to the kindling of Fevers.</p>
            <p>For this <hi>Sulphureous</hi> oleaginous matter, that now ſeparates; (the blood being <hi>out</hi> of the <hi>Veins,</hi> cold and putrifying) was not ſo; in conjunction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture with the reſt; (when <hi>hot</hi> in the <hi>Veins,</hi> its proper place) making one <hi>Homogeneous</hi> liquor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then under ſubjection to vital power.</p>
            <p>And I anſwer this <hi>Author</hi> in his own words; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuting the <hi>Galenic</hi> doctrine of the four humors of the Blood: <hi>eſt enim ſanguis revera humor unicus.</hi> And preſently after he adds theſe words. <hi>Sed liquor in vaſis efferveſcens ſolummodo ſanguis &amp; ubicunque loci per ſingulas corporis partes defertur, uſque idem eſt, &amp; ſui ſimilis.</hi> D. <hi>Willis. de febr.</hi> p. 99.</p>
            <pb n="47" facs="tcp:33858:28"/>
            <p>If the Blood then be in ſuch a ſtate (as this <hi>Author</hi> even now ſaid) perfectly <hi>mixed</hi> and <hi>homogeneous</hi> in the veſſels: I ſee no cauſe why; and cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how this <hi>ſulphureous</hi> part thereof (if ſuch there be) in living Blood; that it ſhould be apt and ready to take fire, and produce the efferveſcency and ebul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of putrid Fevers.</p>
            <p>Nor can I reconcile this learned Man to himſelf; where in another place, ſetting forth <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers; he ſaith:
<q>
                  <hi>Cum vero cruoris materies ſulphurea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candeſcens ſupra modum effervet, mixtionis vinculum maxima ex parte ſolvitur, ut principia ejus à fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cordis fere in totum diſtrahantur, &amp; particulae activae</hi> (meaning ſpirit and ſulphur) <hi>à miſto ſolutae velut in flammam erumpant.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>Ibidem.</hi> p. 164.</p>
            <p>In one place he affirms the Blood to be a liquor united in its principles, woven together into one uniform nature: and in another place he ſays; the parts of the Blood are looſed, and in a ſtate of ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>Now when the Blood is thus diſſolved; the <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> does not abide to take <hi>fire,</hi> but takes flight;
<q>
                  <hi>Subſtantia Sulphuris nuſquam ſincera cernitur, imo ſeorſim ab aliis non conſiſtit, quin tenues evaneſcit in auras:</hi>
               </q> D. <hi>Willis lib. de ferment.</hi> p. 7.</p>
            <p>Obſerve from hence: The Blood in its <hi>compage</hi> and <hi>texture,</hi> is not capable of firing and deflagration; in its <hi>retexture</hi> and diſſolution, the inflammable Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur abides not for a combuſtion, but diſperſeth and vaniſheth; <hi>&amp; haec tota Doctrina in flammam abit: Sic tranſit gloria ficti.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="48" facs="tcp:33858:29"/>
            <p>Notwithſtanding theſe <hi>incongruities;</hi> He proceeds to make out the <hi>deflagration</hi> of the Blood in <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers:
<q>That the principles of the Blood are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the <hi>ferment</hi> of the <hi>Heart;</hi> and being there rarified and kindled; from thence with a moſt ſwift motion, <hi>(motu rapidiſſimo)</hi> is carried through the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and in the <hi>deflagration</hi> diſperſeth many effiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums of Heat. <hi>Ibidem,</hi> p. 164.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſoon ſaid, but not ſo eaſily proved. And in anſwer to all this; I will give you the ſentiment, and determination of a late <hi>Phyſician</hi> of great repute, reaſoning and denying all this, as irrational.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Verum nec in ſanguine talem ebullitionem excitari; nec in corde hujuſmodi fermentum adeſſe, facile erit oſtendere: quanquam enim inter corpora quae ex ſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus contraria prorſus indole praeditis conſtant, ubi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcentur, magna efferveſcentia atque lucta exoritur, multaque effluvia diſcedant; diſſimilis tamen omnino &amp; magis benignae naturae Sanguinis liquor exiſtit, quam ut in corde aut vaſis ſuis, tam aeſtuoſe &amp; ſubito effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcat: quippe novimus, quam mitis ejus liquor, quam benigno plerumque ſucco perfuſus, quam lenis &amp; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidus ejus in venis verſus cor refluxus;</hi>— D. <hi>Lower, de corde.</hi>
               </q> p. 57.</p>
            <p>And farther, to null this <hi>fiction</hi> of abounding <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and efferveſcency from thence in <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers: Take the teſtimony of a learned <hi>Chymical</hi> Phyſician, demonſtrating by fact.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The pretended ſanguine ſulphur, or Cacochymy of any in a high Fever, doth afford more ſalt, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:33858:29"/>and Earth, each of them, than ſulphur. I have taken that Diſeaſed Blood termed Corrupt; which might ſeem to ſome, to abound with ſulphur: And being cleanly conveyed into a Retort with a Receiver joined thereto, I have by a gradual fire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated very ſtrictly, brought over what poſſibly I could. In the upſhot upon the ſeparation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral parts, I have found very little of ſulphur, in compariſon of each of the other.</q> Dr. <hi>Thompſon. Aimatiaſis,</hi> chap. 6. p. 51.</p>
            <p>Then he gives you another experiment:
<q>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured (ſaith He) the pureſt Blood I could get from a healthful perſon, putting it to the ſame igneous tryal, as the former degenerate, of equal propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it: Then after ſequeſtration of the parts, I could not perceive any conſiderable difference, in the quantity, or quality of the ſeveral parts of the Sound, and that ſeeming Corrupt; which gives teſtimony that a Fever doth not principally ariſe from an exceſs of <hi>Sulphur, Idem, Ibidem.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Much more might be alledged againſt this impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable opinion: But I think there is enough ſaid to diſpel the fiction of <hi>inflammable Sulphur</hi> in the <hi>Blood;</hi> which is made the riſe of <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers, cauſing effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency, ebullition, and deflagration.</p>
            <p>And now I cannot but admire, that the learned of this <hi>Nation,</hi> ſhould receive this <hi>phantaſm</hi> with ſuch applauſe; and what advantage it brought to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor:</hi> But the handſome <hi>latin</hi> Dreſs that this was preſented in; ſo captivated their underſtandings, that they could not perceive the <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>vanity</hi> of
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:33858:30"/>the Doctrine; <hi>that</hi> ſet it off; and ſo it paſs'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>And frequently ſince, we have had other <hi>Phyſick</hi> works come abroad; which affords me more <hi>matter,</hi> and <hi>Men</hi> to oppoſe; but little to inform, and be a gainer by: yet if it be <hi>latin,</hi> then it is learned with many: But I do not judge of <hi>learning,</hi> nor of men <hi>learned,</hi> after that manner: I am not to be ſnared with any <hi>language,</hi> when I expect ſomething elſe that I ſeek for, <hi>Truth,</hi> is <hi>truth</hi> in any language; <hi>errour</hi> is ſo likewiſe: 'Tis the <hi>matter</hi> in writing, not the <hi>Stile</hi> of writing, that is uſeful, and praiſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy in <hi>Phyſick.</hi> But this by the way.</p>
            <p>Now after all this labour, and ingenuity of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by learned Men, ſetting forth how <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers are generated; I find <hi>Helmont</hi> that great Philoſopher and Phyſician, denying there are any ſuch common Fevers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sciant igitur Scholae, cruorem in venis putrefieri nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, quin ſimul ipſamet vena putreat, ut in Gangrena &amp; mortificationibus. Helm. lib. de Febr. cap.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>He acknowledgeth the putredinous excrements in veins; not the Blood to putrifie: And he ſubjoins this reaſon; <hi>quippe qui juxta Sacra; eſt Sedes, &amp; theſaurus vitae. —ſi vitanon ſervet à putridine ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem in quo gliſcit, quomodo preſervabuntur oſſa. Ibidem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The meaning of all this I judg; is to take away the frequency of putrid Fevers; that they are not ſo common as Authors and Practiſers do make them:
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:33858:30"/>That the putrid matter of Fevers Salutary, is not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction of the Blood: For when the Blood is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trified, the caſe is mortal. <hi>A Corrupto ſive privato, non datur regreſſus ad vitam.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the maſs of Blood comes to be corrupt in the great ſtreams of the Veins and Arteries, there is no hopes of reducing it; but death ſoon follows.</p>
            <p>Now you muſt underſtand the difference, and diſtinguiſh between <hi>putrifying,</hi> and <hi>putrifyed: putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio incipiens, infieri;</hi> and putrefaction <hi>in facto eſſe,</hi> finiſhed: The firſt is curable, the latter incurable. But after all this Diſſention and Contention in and about putrid Feavers; what certain knowledge have we in this Diſeaſe ſo called, but a Name? Since the material Cauſe, or Matter offending (giving the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination) is not adjudged and agreed upon: And how then ſhall a proper Method, with effectual true Medicines be adapted for their Cures?</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs; had I no Knowledge, nor Guide to direct me herein, but Books; I ſhould be at a ſtand, and much puzled what Courſe to ſteer; and with what Means to do the Buſineſs required or aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, when ſuch Fevers preſent.</p>
            <p>But how pernicious are the Methods and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines for the Cure hereof, as appointed by Authors; we ſhall ſee anon, when I come to ſet forth the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>

            <p>Continual <hi>Fevers</hi> are ſuch as have no perfect Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but only ſometimes they have <hi>Intenſions</hi> and <hi>Remiſſions:</hi> And from the difference of their exacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations in Diſtance; whether every Day, or every third, or fourth Day; they are called Continual Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan.

            <p>Intermitting <hi>Fevers</hi> are ſuch, as in the Engliſh are called <hi>Agues:</hi> And theſe are <hi>Quotidian, Tertian,</hi> and <hi>Quartan;</hi> from their Ceſſations and Intermiſſions, coming and going on ſuch Days.</p>

            <head>SECT. VI. <hi>Of Fevers Malignant, ſo called: Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, Small-Pox, and Peſtilential.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HERE we make <hi>Malignant</hi> as the <hi>Genus,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing ſeveral <hi>Species</hi> under that general Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. I ſhall firſt examine the Import of the word, what is meant thereby; and then inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the particular differences of Malignant Diſeaſes: For if we have not a true knowledge of the Senſe and Import of the <hi>generical</hi> word; we cannot have a diſtinct intelligible Account of the <hi>Species</hi> or kinds thereof.</p>
            <p>I hear great talk of <hi>Malignant</hi> Fevers ſometimes; and I Conſult Authors upon that Subject: But I am not ſatisfied what they mean; and ſo far as I can ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Diſcourſes, they do not well know what they mean themſelves; at leaſt, not how to ſet it forth: For they have laboured to explicate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Scope of the word <hi>Malignant;</hi> and rank it with intellible Doctrine: But in fine, the Reſult terminates in <hi>occult</hi> Qualities.</p>
            <p>And this is acknowledged by a late famous Author, treating of malignant and peſtilential Fevers.
<q>
                  <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notam ducunt originem, ut earum Cauſae, &amp; eſſentia

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>How comes this word Malignant, to be tackt, as an Adjunct belonging to Fevers? Malignant Fevers ſo much, and often treated; I know none ſuch. For, all febrile Heat <hi>(in gradu Summo, &amp; remiſſo)</hi> is but the ſame Heat in ſpecie, iſſuing from the ſame vital Principle, and only differing gradually.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, thoſe Fevers which are called <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant;</hi> are obſerved by the beſt Judgments, to have their Heat more <hi>mild</hi> and <hi>moderate,</hi> than other <hi>Fevers</hi> that are accounted, and termed <hi>benign:</hi> Therefore <hi>malignant</hi> affixed to <hi>Fevers,</hi> as a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character; is an improper Compounding, and Confounding of words together; making the Senſe and Meaning thereof intricate and perplext; which breeds confuſion, and miſtakes in Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clarioris Doctrinae gratiâ, nec non verioris;</hi> we muſt firſt underſtand, what that thing is, which truly may be called <hi>Malignant.</hi> Then Secondly; to what, this Malignant Thing bears Enmity or evil againſt, which it would hurt. Theſe two Points being right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtated; illuſtrates and clears the Doctrine from Obſcurity, Ambiguity and Intanglement.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Malignant</hi> by the Import of the word, ſignifies Evil, Malicious, and Hurtful: And it is uſed by <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians</hi> to ſet forth that which is very Evil, Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and Dangerous, more than ordinary. And therefore Diſeaſes ariſing from ſuch malignant Cauſes are accounted worſe than others.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:33858:33"/>
            <p>That which denominates and makes Diſeaſes <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant;</hi> is either ſome inbred Matter in Human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, highly and variouſly degenerated into a <hi>malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> venemous ſtate; as producing Cancers, Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grens, Leproſie, Small-Pox, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this variouſly depraved <hi>malignant</hi> Matter; is capable of no other Deſcription and Diſtinction; than what the Symptomatical Products and Effects thereof, does manifeſt the <hi>Heterogenity</hi> of ſuch cauſes in Human Bodies. Pertinent to our Purpoſe <hi>Van Helmont</hi> Speaks, tho' about to prove ſomething elſe:
<q>
                  <hi>Excrement<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>m venenoſum in Febribus, praecordis, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludi, producens ſopores, deliria, &amp;c. ergo virus ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum eſt, &amp; amens. In caducis paritur eſſe venenum inſenſitivum &amp; amens, pro ſpatio affligens, in praecor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diis ſtabulatum. In Amentiis hypochondriacis, venenum fur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oſum, vel cum joco delirans. In vertigine, virus rotans. In apoplexia, tollens ſenſum &amp; motum,</hi>—</q> p. 268.</p>
            <p>Hence you may underſtand; that great variety of venemous <hi>malignant</hi> matter, is ſometimes generated in Human Body, producing many different, and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Effects, afflicting variouſly.</p>
            <p>Or elſe Secondly; <hi>Malignant</hi> Diſeaſes are cauſed and received from without: As when the Air (that ſurrounds and enters the Body) is infected with noxious exhalations, and vaporous malignant <hi>efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viums,</hi> ariſing out of the Earth; from carrion or dead Bodies; expirations of <hi>venemous</hi> Creatures; or by <hi>Influx</hi> of the Stars; producing epidemical <hi>Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> Diſeaſes: As the <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> or Peſtilential, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:33858:33"/>malignant in a lower Degree. Or by the <hi>Bite</hi> of ſome venemous Creature; or by depraved Corrupt Food, or virulent Phyſick.</p>
            <p>And this malignant matter, whether inbred; or imperceptible Miaſms from without: they do ſhew their Pravity, Taint and Infection, by the direful deſtructive <hi>Symptoms,</hi> that attend their Operations, and Alterations made in Human Body variouſly. <hi>Quicquid recipitur, recipitur per modum recipientis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>malignant</hi> Matter being more <hi>acute delete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,</hi> does deſtroy ſooner: Others not ſo fierce and active, do take more <hi>Time</hi> in killing; yet are more difficult and obſtinate in yielding to means, than other Diſeaſes that are not malignant.</p>
            <p>All which does prove; that Diſeaſes are rightly called malignant, from the material Cauſe only, of which they are bred.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly;</hi> We muſt diſcern to what more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly, this <hi>malignant</hi> matter is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to, and where it makes the <hi>firſt</hi> Attack, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; where the Streſs of <hi>Malignity</hi> aims <hi>firſt,</hi> and lyes moſt upon.</p>
            <p>Not to, and upon <hi>animal Spirits;</hi> becauſe the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Contrariety, is not founded between them as <hi>Antagoniſts:</hi> For, granting there were no <hi>animal Spirits</hi> in Human Nature; the Repugnancy, Diſcord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Hoſtility by <hi>malignant</hi> venom would be the ſame; and the ſymptomatical Effects in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſame.</p>
            <pb n="58" facs="tcp:33858:34"/>
            <p>And it is but rational ſo to determine: Becauſe <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>Antipathy,</hi> Amity and Oppoſition in the nature of Creatures; iſſue immediately from the <hi>Life</hi> of one, and points directly at the <hi>Life</hi> of the other. Inclinations and Averſations ariſe from thence, and the <hi>firſt</hi> Impreſſions are made there, for mutual Complacency, or Reſiſtance.</p>
            <p>That which is venemous and deſtructive to <hi>one</hi> creature; is not hurtful to <hi>another;</hi> and ſerves for Food to ſome: The <hi>Dog</hi> and other Animals, eats <hi>Carrion;</hi> and it's good Food for them; The which would be deſtructive to <hi>Man,</hi> as Poyſon. What can make this difference of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> among the Creatures, but the <hi>Specific</hi> Formative <hi>Principle,</hi> that fabricated thoſe Bodies, and from whence all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing Properties do flow?</p>
            <p>And not only Creatures of a different <hi>Species;</hi> but alſo <hi>Individuals</hi> of the <hi>ſame</hi> Species, do differ much in their Appetitions and Averſations: according to the <hi>Proverb;</hi> one Man's Meat, is another Man's Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And this Peculiarity and Individual Propriety, does ariſe from the <hi>Life,</hi> and not otherwiſe from <hi>animal</hi> Spirits; The Diſcordancy and Reluctance, is not founded there.</p>
            <p>The vital <hi>Principle,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> or <hi>Form;</hi> is that which diſtinguiſheth all the Creatures <hi>eſſentially</hi> in their <hi>Being:</hi> And alſo gives them their different In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and Diſpoſitions, Properties and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:33858:34"/>
            <p>From hence we may underſtand; that the firſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault and Injuries offered, either from without, or within the Body, is made upon the <hi>Life:</hi> That what agrees or diſagrees, is by Approbation, or Rejection and Diſplicency of the <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>animal Spirits</hi> (if ſuch there be) do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>firſt</hi> Aſſault of <hi>Malignant</hi> and <hi>Venemous</hi> matter; they are not primely concern'd therein: But <hi>(ex falſis ſuppoſitis)</hi> they can only feel the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, <hi>ſecundario &amp; conſequenter,</hi> from the conflict and ſtruglings, the irregular and diſturb'd Impulſes of the <hi>Life:</hi> They being ſupported, and ill govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereby, in the execution of their Functions.</p>
            <p>I muſt not believe, the firſt Commotion and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance to make a Diſeaſe, is begun among the <hi>animal Spirits;</hi> or any thing elſe ſo inferiour in Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, that's Subſervient, and inſtrumental: Nor can I think the continuation of Diſeaſes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them. The <hi>Life</hi> or vital <hi>Principle,</hi> being ubiquitary in its Dominions; always guarding and upon the Defence; is <hi>firſt</hi> ſenſible of injury offered; forthwith endeavours <hi>Repulſion</hi> and <hi>Expulſion,</hi> and that's the Diſeaſe begun.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Helmont</hi> ſays true (as I am apt to believe;) <hi>mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bem omnem in vita Conſiſtere.</hi> P. 444. Then doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Diſeaſes muſt there <hi>firſt</hi> begin; nor does it end, until the <hi>Life</hi> be clear, and quit thereof; by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of good Means when greatly aſſaulted and ſeized. And he confirms this in another place: <hi>ut Sanitas conſiſtit in vita integra, ita morbus, in ipſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met vitaoblaſa.</hi> p. 442.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:33858:35"/>
            <p>All which does ſuggeſt and prove; that <hi>animal Spirits</hi> (if ſuch there were) are not primely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd and affected, with any diſcordant malignant Matter that is <hi>fomes Morborum;</hi> but collaterally or conſequentionally, from the Irritations and Diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of the <hi>Life;</hi> by whom they are ſupported, managed, and act inſtrumentally.</p>
            <p>If ſo as moſt probably appearing; then the new Hypotheſis, ſetting forth the Riſe, and Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Diſeaſes by <hi>animal Spirits</hi> principally affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; is not rightly bottom'd and ſtated; but found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon unſound Principles; and the Practice form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hereby, erroneous and unſafe.</p>
            <p>Now I have ſhewed what <hi>malignant</hi> Matter is, that cauſeth ſuch a Diſeaſe; And to what this Matter aims, or where it primely affects and ſeizeth, to produce a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> called <hi>Malignant.</hi> We are next to inquire how properly, or improperly and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, Fevers are denominated Malignant.</p>
            <p>Fevers upon due examination, unfitly are called malignant.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe <hi>malignant</hi> denotes only, and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies <hi>Matter,</hi> properly diſtinguiſhes it from other <hi>Matter</hi> and Morbifick Cauſes: And <hi>Fever</hi> imports only <hi>febrile</hi> prenatural Heat, ariſing from the <hi>Life</hi> or vital <hi>Principle</hi> incenſed, from any diſturbing cauſe whatſoever. <hi>Malignant</hi> can give no <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Character to <hi>Fever;</hi> for <hi>febrile</hi> Heat in all caſes is <hi>(idem ſpecie)</hi> the ſame in kind; and only differing in Degree, as being more, or leſs. <hi>Febrile</hi> Heat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:33858:35"/>cannot be <hi>Malignant,</hi> becauſe the Spring or Principle of that <hi>Heat</hi> is the <hi>Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; They diſſent by <hi>Indications</hi> in Curing: <hi>Malignant</hi> requiring <hi>Alexipharmacal,</hi> and Bezoardic Medicines: And <hi>Fever</hi> or <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, indicates <hi>refrigerating</hi> or Cooling means, according to the common Practice and Galenic Canon: <hi>Contraria con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariis Curantur.</hi> But I ſay, <hi>Febrile</hi> preternatural Heat being only <hi>Symptomatical</hi> and dependant upon the <hi>Life;</hi> requires no Curing means directly and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly thereto; but is allayed and reduced of courſe; by various Means, ſuch as is proper only for that Diſeaſe, which cauſeth the <hi>Life</hi> to aeſtuate, and be diſcompoſed.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; They differ widely, and are incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly yoaked; becauſe (as coupled) they do not thereby illuſtrate and direct; but darken and amuſe a Practicer, in determining the <hi>quid agendum,</hi> and <hi>quibus auxiliis.</hi> You muſt therefore divide, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate <hi>Fever</hi> from <hi>malignant;</hi> conſidering them apart in their ſingle diſtinct Natures, as proceeding from much different <hi>Principles;</hi> that you may rightly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at, and oppoſe the <hi>evil;</hi> and not ſtifle the <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly; <hi>Malignant</hi> is improperly affixed to <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;</hi> for that which makes the Fever <hi>efficienter,</hi> and from whence <hi>febrile</hi> Heat does iſſue; is <hi>(fons calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris)</hi> the very <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf: Therefore <hi>Fever</hi> is not <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant,</hi> but the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> may fitly be called <hi>malignant;</hi> from the morbifick <hi>malignant</hi> matter, which is the <hi>conſtituent</hi> cauſe thereof. From whence we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; that many and various <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> going un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:33858:36"/>the Name of <hi>Fevers;</hi> are very indirectly dealt with, by a wrong Information, as being falſly deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and miſtaken.</p>
            <p>Fifthly; <hi>Malignant</hi> is injuriouſly added to <hi>Fever,</hi> as an appellative and diſtinguiſhing character; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Fever</hi> is no <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> but a <hi>Symptom;</hi> or <hi>(ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num commune)</hi> a ſignal only that the <hi>Life</hi> is male af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected: But how, or with what, <hi>febrile</hi> Heat makes no Diſcovery; nor requires any curative Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But malignant denominates a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; diſtinguiſheth the <hi>Morbific</hi> cauſe from other Matter, and thereby <hi>indicates</hi> the Curing means: Therefore <hi>Malignant</hi> having no Relation to <hi>Fever,</hi> but <hi>remotely</hi> and <hi>occaſionally;</hi> is no <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Title for Fever; and joining them together; does not inform, but <hi>amuſe</hi> by contraindication.</p>
            <p>Sixthly; <hi>Symptoms</hi> ariſing from <hi>morbific</hi> Matter; as <hi>Vomiting, Fluxes,</hi> immoderate <hi>Sweating,</hi> and ſuch like; may receive a diſtinguiſhing Denomination, peculiar and appoſite, as ſhewing the Nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and if urgent may require Means for Palliation and Mitigation: But <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, a common Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom of the <hi>Life</hi> male affected; is not capable of Diſtinction by any Addition; becauſe it proceeds al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways from <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> Principle, tho' the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing</hi> or <hi>occaſional</hi> Cauſes be ever ſo different and various: And requires no Means peculiar thereto, but ſuch as is proper and Curative for the Diſeaſe only, that occaſioned the aeſtuation.</p>
            <p>By the common Doctrine, we are hitherto at a loſs in the Notion of <hi>Fevers;</hi> being no Diſeaſe, and requiring no Curing means adapt thereto; giving
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:33858:36"/>little Information, and is no true <hi>Guide</hi> in the cure of any <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> that is Couched under that Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: But they being entituled <hi>Fevers,</hi> hath cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed great miſtakes, and dictated injurious <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Medicines;</hi> deceiving many <hi>Practiſers,</hi> with the Ruine of many <hi>Patients:</hi> The appearance of a <hi>Fever,</hi> hath ſo long detained them unneceſſarily and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, in applying to damp and extinguiſh the <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile</hi> vital Heat, (thereby ſuppreſſing the fortitude of Nature) and giving Time to the <hi>morbifie</hi> Cauſe for prevailing.</p>
            <p>Having gained little ſatisfaction in the <hi>doctrinal</hi> Part of <hi>Fevers;</hi> we will now paſs on to the next Stage, the <hi>Curative</hi> Practice. We ſhall then ſee whether Curing comes by <hi>Chance,</hi> and ſometimes only; or is the Effect of certain true Deſign, and right adapted <hi>Means,</hi> as the moſt frequent Event.</p>

            <head>SECT. VII. <hi>The Operations and Effects of Cortex Peruvianus, the Jeſuits Powder.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BEfore I give my Sentiment of this <hi>famed</hi> Remedy, ſo much uſed againſt <hi>Fevers;</hi> I ſhall firſt recite the Opinions of ſome <hi>Authors</hi> thereupon: And then comparing Judgments, with the matters of Fact, you may eaſily know, who comes neareſt the Truth; in determining the virtue, or Vitioſity of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in his Book <hi>de Febribus,</hi> put forth in the Year 1660; makes mention of this <hi>Cortex,</hi> which he had often uſed, and was then reputed a certain <hi>Febrifuge:</hi> But he does not ſay it was a <hi>Remedy</hi> adapt to his Doctrine of Fevers; but only an empyrical Medicine, and pretends not to know the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; why, and how this ſhould Cure <hi>Fevers.</hi> p. 154.</p>
            <p>And in another Place he ſaith:
<q>That ſometimes it did prevent the next Fit to come, but if not, then the ſecond, or third Fit was thereby prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Fever Cured: Yet this Cure laſted for a while only; for within twenty or thirty Days <hi>(ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſſime redire ſolet)</hi> moſt often it returned again. <hi>P.</hi> 152. Then the Pouder was to be given again; and that would make another Ceſſation. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this manner (ſaith He) I have known many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:33858:37"/>with a quartan, a whole Autumn, and the Winter following, to be thus handled: The Fever kept off for a Time, and returning again, until the Spring came: Then by the Help of Phyſick, and the Change of the Seaſon, the ill Diſpoſition of Blood was altered, and the Fever by Degrees va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. </q> 
               <hi>P.</hi> 152.</p>
            <p>What great Cauſe is here to boaſt of, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the <hi>Jeſuits Powder,</hi> for an excellent <hi>Febrifuge?</hi> many of the common Medicines have done as much.</p>
            <p>And in the Page following; He adviſeth this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine to be given <hi>(urgente Neceſſitate)</hi>
               <q>When the Patient is worn down by continuance of <hi>Fits;</hi> this <hi>Febrifuge</hi> makes a Ceſlation for a Time, that Strength may be recovered, to be able to contend with the Diſeaſe. And if you would have a long <hi>Truce,</hi> you muſt take larger quantities of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; by that means you will be longer free from your <hi>Ague.</hi>
               </q> P. 153.</p>
            <p>Thus he commends it for a <hi>Palliative</hi> only; not a compleat <hi>Curative</hi> Medicine. This Phyſician of great Name, and a vaſt Practice; had more oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to try the worth of this <hi>Bark,</hi> than any Man in the Kingdom: And by his writings you may ſee, that he had made various Tryals thereof; whoſe Judgment in the uſe of it; and the Verity in matters of Fact, I do depend upon: And therefore ſhall eſteem of it, no more, than what He ſaith of it. <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitandum non eſt, quin alia in rerum natura extent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicamina, quae ſunt aeque febrifuga.</hi> P. 156.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:33858:38"/>
            <p>For my Part; I never had ſuch an Opinion of it, as to put me upon many Experiments in the uſe of it: Becauſe I had another Medicine, which proved more certain, in Stopping any <hi>Quotidian, Tertian,</hi> or <hi>Quartan Ague;</hi> and alſo for removing the <hi>Morbific</hi> Matter out of the Body, to prevent any Return: And without ſuch Security, the Patient is not ſafe, and in a hopeful condition.</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> in his <hi>Pyretologia</hi> is of another mind; and extols this Pouder above all things (<hi>efficaciae mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilis ſanè ac Stupendae.</hi> p. 242.) and as a <hi>univerſal</hi> Remedy, appoints it in Fevers and moſt Diſeaſes: This being choſen as adapt, to ſupport the new Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis of animal Spirits male affected in all caſes; by venom in the moſt, requiring <hi>Alexipharmacals.</hi> And this <hi>Aetiology</hi> of Diſeaſes (againſt the antient Doctrine of <hi>Humors</hi>) he eſpouſeth, and labours to maintain; by proving the methods of Curing, to be governed hereby; and the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder</hi> as the chiefeſt Remedy.</p>
            <p>I am not ſo much a <hi>Humoriſt,</hi> as to aſſert the <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternary</hi> of the <hi>Galeniſts;</hi> deriving all Diſeaſes from thence; diſtinguiſhing them thereby, and adapting peculiar Medicines thereto: But in all Diſeaſes (as the Cauſe, or the Product) there is degenerate Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo various in divers Perſons, as not to be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to four Heads; and we may rationally judge the depravedneſs thereof, by the ſymptoms ariſing from thence; more or leſs dangerous as the Faculties are diſordered or hurt; and Curing reſults from bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling and diſcharging ſuch offenſive Matter. To diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe this farther, would draw us more out of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:33858:38"/>way of our preſent Purpoſe; therefore I wave it, and return to the <hi>Peruvian Bark.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To have a true aeſtimate of this <hi>Remedy;</hi> we muſt examine it, by the manifeſt Qualities it is endowed with; By the manner of its Operation: And from the Effects or Succeſs, that uſually attends it. Theſe are the only ways to diſcover the genuine Nature, and Virtues of this <hi>Cortex.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Herein I ſhall not be guided, or byaſſed by the Accuſations, and Invectives of ſome foreign Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (Men of Note) againſt this Cortex: I ſhall wave their Arguments, and the Faults they object; that I may not be accounted an Enemy to this Medicine, by joyning with the great oppoſers of it; tho' I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay, I am ſo much a Friend, as to promote and incourage the uſe of it. But I ground my Judgment of this Remedy, from thoſe that are the great Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauders of it; who give all the Advantages they can, in ſetting it forth by Argument and <hi>Fact:</hi> From their <hi>Expreſſions</hi> and <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> I ſhall raiſe ſome Doubts; and make ſome Exceptions againſt the validity and worth of this famous <hi>Febrifuge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manifeſt Qualities attributed to it, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, are theſe: <hi>Hot,</hi> and <hi>Dry, Bitter,</hi> and <hi>Stip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> or <hi>reſtrictive.</hi> But theſe do not perform the great work of a Counter-Poyſon; That is effected by an <hi>occult</hi> Quality, they ſay: And I will grant your <hi>occult</hi> Quality, wherein you place the Efficacy of this Antidote: But with this <hi>proviſo;</hi> that you make it out clearly, and prove it by the Effects: For, if you cannot make it appear <hi>à pricri,</hi> in the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>; elſe we muſt believe againſt all Reaſon and Senſe.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hypotheſis occult</hi> (as not fairly proved) and the <hi>Remedy occult,</hi> in its chief reputed virtue: I wiſh the good <hi>effects</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs,</hi> may not be <hi>occult</hi> alſo; or only to found, <hi>inter rar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The three foremoſt Qualities named, I like well, and the fourth, I do not diſlike in ſome Caſes: But when Nature is upon the Expulſion, and makes an Effort, to ſend off the Morbific Matter by <hi>Vomit,</hi> or <hi>Stool:</hi> Then the <hi>Aſtriction</hi> may be injurious, and checks Nature in freeing her ſelf from that which is <hi>hoſtile:</hi> And tho' it may be ſaid, the reſtringent virtue is moderate; that ſeems to mitigate <hi>à tanto:</hi> Notwithſtanding this <hi>Febrifuge</hi> not being indicated in the Caſe; may be blamed, and be the occaſion or cauſe of much miſcheif; in keeping out another Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which ought to come in uſe, as more proper and fit at ſuch a time.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Cortex Cinnamomum</hi> is much more grateful and Stomachical, than this <hi>Peruvian</hi> Drug: But to give that innocent and wholeſome reſtringent <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diac,</hi> to check a Flux <hi>Diarrhaea,</hi> or <hi>Lienteria;</hi> is not according to the Rules of Art; But an abſterſive true <hi>Purgative,</hi> is in Reaſon, and by Practice confirm'd, moſt ſafe and ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>I grant you; when Malignity and venemous Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the Stimulating Cauſe: As in the Small <hi>Pox,</hi> Spotted <hi>Fevers,</hi> or <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> the beſt <hi>Alexiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macals,</hi> and <hi>Diaphoretics,</hi> are then the greateſt and ſecureſt Help. (But whether the Jeſuits Pouder be
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:33858:39"/>the ſupreme Antidote, and moſt to be confided, in ſuch caſes; we ſhall inquire anon) But <hi>Fluxes per Alvum</hi> moſt commonly are not ſo malign, and the Ferment not <hi>venenate;</hi> and do then require only a true gentle <hi>Purgative:</hi> This moſt Practiſers will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſent to.</p>
            <p>I do not accuſe the Medicine of Evil in the Nature of it; but the evil uſe of it; and therein the beſt of things may do hurt; and ſo may this, when uſed, more often than neceſſary; under the Pretence of animal <hi>Spirits invenom'd</hi> in Fevers, and moſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; according to the new, and falſe Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis.</p>
            <p>For the <hi>Manner</hi> of <hi>Operation;</hi> thoſe that confide moſt in this Medicine, cannot ſhew how it operates; but tells us negatively: Not by Salivation, Vomit, Stool, Urine, or Sweat; as Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> ſaith; <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retol.</hi> p. 142. And for my Part; I ſhould not eſteem the Medicine worſe or leſs, for the inſenſible Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; always provided, it did perform the work intended, and give ſufficient Proof thereof.</p>
            <p>But when I ſee a Failure in the Performance, or a ſeeming and fallacious Performance, <hi>pro tempore</hi> only, or commonly ſo: (as Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> obſerves) Then my Faith ſtaggers, and begins to fail; that I cannot hope, or truſt any longer, in <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>inſenſible</hi> Operation: For, the <hi>morbifio</hi> cauſe being laid aſleep only, and a Ceſſation made for a Time; yet it will, and frequently does <hi>reſurge</hi> again; ſhewing its Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in acting as before: This Experience does con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, from Authors of Credit; and by common Fame.</p>
            <pb n="70" facs="tcp:33858:40"/>
            <p>If the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder</hi> thus deceive us; in the only, or chiefeſt caſes, wherein we wanted extraordinary Help; as, for Intermitting Fevers; eſpecially the Quartans: Then where is the excellency of that Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuge? For other occaſions there are Medicines enough; and for thoſe Agues (for ought I yet ſee) there are as good; and ſome that are better.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding the Operation is ſaid to be ſo <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>charming;</hi> yet ſometimes it plays <hi>Tricks</hi> openly and unexpectedly: By Vomit, by Fluxes downward, and profuſe Sweats. And this is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by a great admirer of this Pouder; who tells us that ſuch Evacutions are <hi>Symptomatical,</hi> from the Irritation of the Medicine. (Dr. <hi>Morton Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tol.</hi> p. 142.) So that it is not ſo calm, ſtill, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effenſive to all People; but ſometimes it gives Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance, with ſuch unprofitable evacuations; as He accounts them ſo in the ſame Page: And truly I ſhould be angry with any Medicine; that ſhould give me ſo much Trouble, without any Benefit.</p>
            <p>From whence I remark; that this <hi>Author</hi> will not own any Evacuation to be proficuous, and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to theſe Cures; leaſt the Doctrine of Humors, ſhould gain Advantage thereby; and the new <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis</hi> infringed. But in this caſe; it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to expect, Advantage from ſuch ſympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic Evacuations, occaſioned and ariſing meerly from diſguſt, and Diſagreement of the Medicine (<hi>Hoc Pharmacum ſuâ Naturâ non admodum gratum.</hi> P. 173.) elſe, <hi>Evacuations</hi> otherwiſe procured, by good Medicine kindly operating; have been bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and Curative.</p>
            <pb n="71" facs="tcp:33858:40"/>
            <p>My Reaſon does not perſuade, nor Experience urge me to believe; that ſecret and inſenſible Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by an <hi>occult</hi> Quality; is ſo prevalent and wonderful in Curing, eſpecially in various caſes and cauſes; as to denominate this ſingle, and ſimple Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>a Polychreſton, Pharmacum hoc divinum, &amp; in pluribus alus morbis, aeque ac in Febre intermittente proficuum,</hi> P. 136. as he ſaith.</p>
            <p>Some Specifics, are ſaid to operate after a ſecret manner; and there is no Reaſon given why, or how they do perform ſuch effects: But theſe are limited and reſtrained, to particular Purpoſes and Diſeaſes; and they are the Secrets of Nature, which as yet are not revealed to us.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder,</hi> goes beyond all thoſe in Latitude and Comprehenſion; for few caſes preſent, that are not within the Virge of its Power, as ſome would have us believe: And it muſt be a Polychreſt, of large extent in Virtue; that makes ſuch Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Curing all Fevers; becauſe Fevers are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, and dependant upon moſt Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Cauſes</hi> are manifeſtly various; alſo ſituate variouſly in the Body; and the Operations or Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Nature are manifeſt, and different; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge and free her ſelf from ſuch ſuperfluous, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious, and uſeleſs Matter; both in her daily courſe of Preſervation; as alſo in extraordinary Caſes and Exigencies: And ſince curing is but in <hi>Imitation</hi> of Nature; to give Help, and aſſiſt her in her own Methods, and by the ways of her own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. <hi>Natura eſt Morborum medicatrix.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="72" facs="tcp:33858:41"/>
            <p>Theſe being conſidered; I cannot then underſtand, this new way of Conjuring Nature into good Order; and reſtoring her <hi>inſenſibly,</hi> and occultly into a State of Sanity; from various Diſeaſes and Sickneſs. But we will argue no farther about the Qualities, and Manner of Operation now; that we may come to the deciſive and undeniable Proof; by Matters of <hi>Fact,</hi> the effects in Practice; which determines all the Doubts, and Difficulties in Controverſy.</p>
            <p>To confirm the new Hypotheſis, and prove the Excellency of Curing by the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder;</hi> Dr. <hi>Morton</hi> gives us an Account, of ſeveral Cures that He hath done by this Febrifuge; and ſets down the Names of the Patients, and Places of their Abode.</p>
            <p>The hiſtorical verity, I queſtion not; but how that Practice, does anſwer the Hypotheſis of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits invenom'd; and proves the wonderful <hi>Alexipharmal</hi> power of the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Antidote; as yet is not apparent to my dull underſtanding: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore give me leave to doubt, and to enquire farther. If thoſe Cures had been performed by the Antidote only; or chiefly, and with a little Help of another Medicine, <hi>pro re nata:</hi> I ſhould have as good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Pouder,</hi> and extol it as much as He doth; and perhaps thereby might become a <hi>Proſelite</hi> to the new Doctrine.</p>
            <p>But when I ſee <hi>Bleeding,</hi> and <hi>Bliſtering, Pericar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> and <hi>Suppedanea, Juleps, Apozems, Purges, Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, Opiats,</hi> &amp;c. (as other Phyſicians uſe) appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Methods of his Cures. And if we muſt believe; thoſe ſeveral Means to act their Part, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:33858:41"/>nothing appointed but what was neceſſary, and by Indication: Who can tell now, upon which the ſtreſs of thoſe Cures did lye? When thoſe Partners in Curing, have each their due ſhare of Praiſe allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; How <hi>much,</hi> or rather How <hi>little</hi> Glory, will be left for the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder?</hi> For we muſt ſuppoſe, that ſuch various means was neceſſarily contributing, (which I ſhall not diſpute now) How then does the <hi>Super-Excellency</hi> of this <hi>Febrifuge</hi> appear, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the high Titles of <hi>Pharmacum divinum, in Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitate in Gentium, ex arbore vitae, &amp;c.</hi> And how does this Practice, differ from other Phyſicians, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Doctrine of Humors and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</p>
            <p>We do know; at leaſt every Practiſer ought to know; that one <hi>morbific</hi> cauſe, perambulating and irritating, or protruded from <hi>Part</hi> to <hi>Part,</hi> or by conſent of Parts; does raiſe various ſymptoms, afflicting ſeveral Faculties, and perverting their Functions. If we apply ſeveral Medicines, to ſuch various ſymptomatical Appearances; and endeavour to help the Sick after that Manner, by a Method and Series of Medicines: Then we cannot boaſt, of any particular Medicine as a <hi>Catholicon</hi> or <hi>Polychreſton;</hi> and extol it as an extraordinary Curing Remedy, and Salutiferous above all other. Beſides, if true Medicine be rightly exhibited againſt the morbific cauſe; there is no farther need of Application, to ſymptomatical dependants.</p>
            <p>For my Part; I am for promoting a <hi>general</hi> and <hi>generous</hi> Medicine, extenſive and comprehenſive; that is applicable and efficacious in various Caſes and Perſons: To eaſe the People (eſpecially ſome ſort)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:33858:42"/>from variety and multiplicity of Medicines, that are both irkſom, and chargeable: And herein I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly ſatisfied, that ſuch Help there is.</p>
            <p>But no Medicine can be ſo generally uſeful, and ſucceſsful; if it hath not a Manifeſt Operation, by which to diſcharge impure morbific Matter, for <hi>clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> and <hi>purifying</hi> the Body. And no Operation ſo advantagious and comprehenſive, againſt many and the moſt of Diſeaſes, as true <hi>Purgative</hi> Operation; and alſo is the beſt preventive Means: Not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the common <hi>virulent</hi> reputed <hi>Purgatives</hi> (that have defamed this Operation) But by Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine compoſed of ſuch wholeſome Ingredients, to do that moſt neceſſary work, as it ought to be done.</p>
            <p>When the People are ſenſible of this, and can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſuch Medicine; they will be the better provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to maintain, and to regain loſt Health; this I am aſſured of. And then they need not have ſuch Recourſe to the <hi>Waters;</hi> whereof ſome do complain afterwards, and not a few; by pouring in ſuch large hazardous <hi>Quantities,</hi> to force a Paſſage. <hi>Mundus vult decipi, &amp; decipiatur.</hi> Information and Caution ſignifies little; Cuſtom, and Example of others, prevails much more; and they chuſe rather to ſuffer, and Dye with the Multitude, than go out of the Road they have been us'd to.</p>
            <p>As for ſuch Medicine whoſe prime Quality is oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, and operateth <hi>occultly;</hi> I cannot believe it to be ſo generally uſeful, and ſo certain in Curing, as a Medicine working Manifeſtly: Moreover, if a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine be ſet up, as an inſignal <hi>Polychreſt,</hi> and to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:33858:42"/>all other: Let us ſee it act its Part ſingly and alone; then we ſhall plainly ſee what it is: But if the <hi>Peruvian Pouder,</hi> be introduced with a crowd of other Medicines; and by much ſtrugling with one and the other, a cure at laſt is gained? Who then can ſay, which of thoſe <hi>many</hi> did the Cure; ſince all bore a Part; and it may be hard to tell, which did moſt, or beſt; the <hi>occult,</hi> or the <hi>manifeſt</hi> Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
            <p>I always thought, and do think ſo ſtill; that an <hi>Antidote</hi> againſt any venom (worthy of that Name) was a certain and ſpeedy <hi>Remedy</hi> to kill the <hi>Poyſon;</hi> and needs no more to do; at leaſt very little: And this <hi>Pouder</hi> ſo magnified, for a ſtupendious <hi>Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge,</hi> and an expeſter of febrile venom; I expected ſome wonderful Performances, by its <hi>occult</hi> vertue; but either I cannot ſee thoſe rare effects; or they are <hi>inviſible</hi> Facts, hid in the crowd; and matter of <hi>Faith</hi> only.</p>
            <p>If the new Hypotheſis be true Doctrine; That there is a <hi>venenous</hi> Ferment, ſeizing the animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; thereby producing various Symptoms in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Parts of the Body: <hi>Fevers, Fluxes, Spaſms, Vomitings, Rigors, Erratic Pains,</hi> &amp;c. And alſo if it is as true; that the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder</hi> is a certain An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote againſt this venemous Matter or Miaſm: Then it neceſſarily follows; that all thoſe <hi>Symptomatical</hi> and dependant Affects, muſt ceaſe and vaniſh, by the uſe of that Medicine which ſubdues the morbific cauſe. <hi>Sublatâ Cauſa, tollitur effactus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if Curing be not the Reſult hereof; then we may conclude; that either the Cauſe is <hi>miſtaken;</hi> or
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:33858:43"/>the Medicine is not of <hi>ſuch</hi> force and virtue, as to maſter and reduce this Venom. Failure in Curing we have found, and that often; as atteſted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: Therefore the Doctrine, or the Medicine, or both; may be queſtioned as deficient and faulty.</p>
            <p>This <hi>venemous</hi> Doctrine, I doubt is apt to intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the <hi>Brain;</hi> Seduce <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and lead out of the way, in <hi>delirant</hi> Contemplation. And therefore by comparing, I have a more firm opinion of the Doctrine of <hi>Humors</hi> and <hi>Qualities</hi> (rightly ſtated) to fix the <hi>Aetiology</hi> of Diſeaſes upon; than upon <hi>animal</hi> Spirits <hi>invenom'd.</hi> And although that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> hath pronounced Damnation againſt the Doctrine of Humors <hi>(exulet, per me in aternum exulet Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophia iſta, &amp; Scientia falſo ſic dicta. Pyretol. ad Lectorem)</hi> yet I hope the Execution of that ſevere ſentence, may be ſuſpended, as long as I ſhall live, and for future Ages.</p>
            <p>But waving the <hi>Doctrine;</hi> let us enquire a little farther into the Medicine, about the <hi>Doſe</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of uſe; from the ſame Author that moſt oft uſeth it, as the chiefeſt in Practice.</p>
            <p>The uſual Doſe for Man or Woman, was two <hi>drams:</hi> But that which is ſold in the Shops now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing counterfeit, decayed, muſty or ſtinking; two <hi>ounces</hi> is but ſufficient, ſays our Author: <hi>Cortex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinarum adulterinus, &amp;c.</hi> p. 169. The Patient that knows nothing of the Matter, is finely brought to Bed! when he muſt take two <hi>ounces</hi> of bad; inſtead of two <hi>drams</hi> of good. Here is <hi>Quantity,</hi> and <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> offenſive; where is the Incouragement, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon this Remedy?</p>
            <pb n="77" facs="tcp:33858:43"/>
            <p>And I muſt remark; that ſince there is ſo great Abuſe in this Drug, ſimply uſed and alone; what ſecurity have you, for all the <hi>compound</hi> Medicines, where <hi>Fraud</hi> cannot be detected? does it not behove every <hi>Phyſician,</hi> to take upon him the Charge and Care of Medicines? when Phyſicians who rely upon the Care and Honeſty of <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> do thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, and proclaim.</p>
            <p>Yet ſome People are ſo far out of their <hi>Wits,</hi> or <hi>Bewitched</hi> in their Underſtanding; that think a <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician</hi> who takes upon him the <hi>Preparation</hi> of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines (according to the Cuſtom of the Antients) to be a Degree lower, than him that preſcribes to the Shops; not diſcerning the <hi>Elder,</hi> from the <hi>Younger</hi> Brother: And do think a <hi>Fee</hi> is ſcarce due to him; at leaſt not ſo much <hi>(cujus contrarium, verum eſt)</hi> ſuch ſort of <hi>Fools</hi> deſerve the Cheat, that are ſo ready to deceive themſelves: I am ſure they are paid off for their Folly. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>The ſame Author appoints the <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark, to be reduced <hi>(in alcool)</hi> into the moſt minute or fineſt Pouder <hi>(quo facilius per habitum corporis trajiciatur.</hi> p. 179.) that it may the more readily paſs through the <hi>habit</hi> of the Body. But if I were to uſe this <hi>Pouder,</hi> I ſhould chuſe rather to have it <hi>groſly</hi> beaten; that the vertue may be extracted only, and conveyed where and how nature pleaſeth: But the Subſtance more fitly to be carried downwards, to be voided with Excrement. For, I cannot think it ſafe; that ſo much Pouder, of a <hi>ligneous</hi> indiſſoluble Subſtance, ſhould commix with the <hi>Blood,</hi> and be imported into the <hi>ſmaller</hi> veſſels; but by <hi>incraſſating</hi> that ſtream,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:33858:44"/>it muſt cauſe obſtructions of very ill conſequence, tho' the Pouder be genuine und true.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is ſo much adulterated and abuſed, as this <hi>Author</hi> tells us; and the <hi>Doſe</hi> therefore to be augmented double, or treble: I cannot think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, but it muſt then make ill work in the Body; and that there will be need of another <hi>Antidote,</hi> or a <hi>Courſe</hi> of Phyſick, againſt the miſchief of this <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous</hi> Febrifuge: And this medicine making no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt Operation; we may fear, that both the <hi>Dregs</hi> of the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and the <hi>Dregs</hi> of the <hi>Medicine,</hi> do remain in the Body.</p>
            <p>Therefore I am apt to believe, it was not for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or no cauſe; that <hi>Vopiſcus Plempius</hi> a learned Phyſician of Note, did charge this <hi>American Bark,</hi> and condemn'd it as guilty of many miſdemeanors, and <hi>Homicide.</hi> His words are theſe: <hi>Plures tertio vel quarto reciderunt: plurique cachectici facti, non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulli mortui. Item Magnates hujus Aulae nominare poſſem, qui ab uſu Pulveris, extenuati ſunt, &amp; ad Phthiſin pracipites facti, in uſu longo lactis Aſinini re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituti fuiſſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not think it neceſſary; that this <hi>Pouder,</hi> or any Medicine of that ſubſtance; ſhould be conveyed <hi>Materialiter,</hi> into every Part of the Body, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge its virtue: Nature does not operate after that manner with Medicinal Help; is not bound to tranſport by <hi>Canals</hi> for her Relief; but tranſmits <hi>virtualiter</hi> and influentially; penetrating <hi>tatam Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium Compaginem.</hi> Diaphoretics operate after the ſame manner. Nor do I think it neceſſary or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient; the beſt and richeſt <hi>Cordial</hi> Pouder, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:33858:44"/>into the Habit of the Body. But let that paſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits Pouder</hi> was cried up, and promoted in <hi>Italy,</hi> by <hi>Sebaſtian Badus</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Genoa:</hi> And there were others, that as much decried it; as not being ſteddy and conſtant in good effects; or doing no Hurt; but oftentimes as being the cauſe of much <hi>ill;</hi> and thereby went under an ill Name. Which Party we are to credit in this matter, I leave every one to Judge.</p>
            <p>This we well know; that the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> by ſeveral Accounts received, about two years ſince; was in a valetudinary State for a long Time; cauſed by an <hi>Ague:</hi> which for many Months continued in going, and coming again. Very probably this <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brifuge</hi> was the chiefeſt Remedy, which put by the Fits for a Time: But the <hi>minera Morbi,</hi> the morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic cauſe not being diſcharged, and ſent forth; the <hi>Fits</hi> returned again ſeveral Times. But Suppoſing his Phyſicians did not adviſe the uſe of this Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; or did not continue the uſe of it: we may conclude, it was under ſome diſgrace, or not in ſuch Repute there, as formerly. But let us go on.</p>
            <p>The Pouder is appointed to be taken in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions of <hi>Ague</hi> Fits, every fourth Hour: And when there is ſuch a Ceſſation of the intermitting <hi>Fever</hi> or <hi>Ague,</hi> as ſeemingly Cured; yet that is no ſecurity; but you muſt Continue the uſe of the <hi>Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> thrice a Day for three Weeks, or a Month, <hi>intervallo octo vel decem Dierum,</hi> as our Author ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points. <hi>P.</hi> 132.</p>
            <pb n="80" facs="tcp:33858:45"/>
            <p>I find hereby, that this famous <hi>Bark,</hi> makes but an uncertain, and a tedious Cure; for when it will be perfected, who can tell? Our Author gives us the Reaſon thereof in another Place. <hi>P.</hi> 76, and 77. to this purpoſe.
<q>That the <hi>febrile venom</hi> hath a fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and determined Time of Duration; either for weeks, months, and ſometimes years: That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be ſubdued and ſeemingly cured for a Time; yet it will revive again, until the venemous fomes <hi>(metam ſuam ultimam attigerit)</hi> hath run its Courſe, and ſpent it ſelf.</q> 
               <hi>P.</hi> 76, and 77.</p>
            <p>If it be ſo; how does the virtue and great Power of the Antidote appear? This is ſmall Hopes for the Patient and little Incouragement to uſe Means; ſince there is ſuch a determinate Time of Cure; and before which it cannot be: But to make us Amends for this great Impediment; And to keep up the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Febrifuge.</p>
            <p>He ſaith;
<q>We may be glad, that we have ſuch a Remedy; as can relieve Nature oppreſſed and worn down, when we pleaſe by this <hi>Febrifuge;</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fatal event.</q> 
               <hi>P.</hi> 77, 78. So that, we are hereby ſecured from Death; but when we may be rid from the <hi>Fever</hi> or <hi>Ague;</hi> that's uncertain, tho' we uſe this great Antidote, famed ſo potent againſt the febrile venom.</p>
            <p>If this be all, that can be expected from this <hi>Pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;</hi> then I ſhall not truſt, to the <hi>occult</hi> Quality of this Medicine; and which makes only an <hi>occult</hi> Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Patient; leaſt the good effects prove <hi>occult</hi> alſo. But I am for a Medicine that works ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly;
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:33858:45"/>and therein more probably, to effect a cure more certainly; by Operations that we know how, and which way a Diſeaſe goes off.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is the <hi>Catholic Extract;</hi> that makes a manifeſt Operation, but very gentle; which is much more pleaſant, and eaſie to take, than the <hi>Peruvian Bark:</hi> And we have more Reaſon, to hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the deſired effects, from this <hi>Catholic</hi> Purifier; becauſe it carries off, and frees the Body from offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, depraved, impure Matter, the <hi>minera morborum</hi> (termed <hi>venom</hi> by this <hi>Author</hi>) thereby it does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form a <hi>radical</hi> Cure of <hi>Agues;</hi> (not a fallacious Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation) and we ſhall not fear a Relaps or Return. (And ſo much I dare promiſe, upon a <hi>Forfeit.</hi>) By ſuch certainty, properly and only; we may call Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Catholic Extract,</hi> being of my own Elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, perfected by divers Alterations and gradual Improvements; I can preſume upon (from many Proofs) to do more, and better ſervice in <hi>Fevers;</hi> (therefore in various Diſeaſes whereon they depend) than any ſingle Medicine, that I can know of, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> in the <hi>World:</hi> And I have examined the beſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and <hi>Pharmacopoeia's</hi> for that Purpoſe. As for <hi>Preſcripts,</hi> the ſudden Inventions <hi>pro re nata;</hi> and ſuddenly to be made at the Shops: I do not inquire for any extraordinary piece of Art in that way, nor in Reaſon can we expect it there.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not here Diſcourſe, the Latitude and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of this Medicine: The excelling Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Operation and Performance; its Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſneſs for uſe, Durability, and Portage, for emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:33858:46"/>occaſions abroad. For my own Part, and particular private uſe; I had rather be deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, of all other Medicines, than to want this; For, I am more beholden to this <hi>Extract,</hi> in eminent Dangers; and for common ſupport of my Life ſince; than all other Medicines I have deſigned, and proved in Forty Years Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
            <p>For a farther Account of the <hi>Catholic</hi> Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, I refer to theſe Tracts: The Myſtery of Curing Comprehenſively, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or <hi>The Efficacy</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of true <hi>Purgation.</hi> Where you have more Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>But above all Reading and Reaſoning; try the two Medicines in like Caſes: And obſerve well the Symptoms and Circumſtances attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one, and the other: in <hi>fine,</hi> tell me then which did beſt; the <hi>manifeſt,</hi> or the <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult</hi> Operation: Then give the Preference to the moſt deſerving; that performed <hi>citò, tutò, jucunde.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Jeſuits Pouder,</hi> is not the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; nor an extraordinary piece of Art, that any Man may claim as his own: But meerly the Product of Nature, <hi>(Caſu &amp; Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiâ)</hi> by Tryals found to do ſomething, but no ſuch great Matters. And therefore no Man is <hi>leſſened,</hi> if that be <hi>lowered</hi> in Aeſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Yet if any one, can ſee farther into it, than another; and diſcover more virtue, than what common Fame hath done, <hi>per me licet:</hi>
               <pb n="83" facs="tcp:33858:46"/>Every Man hath a Freedom herein, to ſay what he knows by <hi>Fact;</hi> or by rational Probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for or againſt: And no man ought to think himſelf affronted, or injured by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions; if it be done without Animoſity, and perſonal Reflection.</p>

            <head>SECT. VIII. <hi>Remarks upon the Jeſuits Pouder, uſed in Clyſter.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>HElvetius</hi> a French Doctor (well eſteemed at the Court of <hi>France</hi>) ſetting forth the Nature of the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder;</hi> gives this Account thereof:
<q>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taking it; one Complains of an intollerable weight, and <hi>Pain</hi> in his <hi>Stomach.</hi> Another, that there is a <hi>diſturbance</hi> in his <hi>Breaſt:</hi> A third, that he feels an extraordinary <hi>Heat:</hi> Another, that he is <hi>ſcorcht</hi> vp by it. In fine, we ſee ſome every Day, tho <hi>Cured</hi> by its means; yet reſolve never to make uſe of it any more.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I mention not the <hi>Complaints</hi> generally made by
<q>the Sick; nor the <hi>Inconveniences</hi> moſt known; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe particular ones which I am going to ſpeak of: <hi>viz.</hi> the illneſs of <hi>Taſte;</hi> the <hi>Nauſeouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> which always attend it, if taken by the <hi>Mouth,</hi> vary how you can in the manner of giving it. That which is ſo much the greater <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Trouble</hi> to the <hi>Patient,</hi> (notwithſtanding the greateſt Averſion after the firſt taking it) is the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Neceſſity of <hi>repeating</hi> it every Day; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for the Space of <hi>ſix Weeks,</hi> or more: And after all, in Caſe of <hi>Relapſe;</hi> the Vexation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:33858:47"/>forced to <hi>begin</hi> all again. <hi>Helvet,</hi> Method of Curing Fevers.</q> 
               <hi>P.</hi> 3, 4, 5. 2d Impreſſion.</p>
            <p>By this Account of his; it plainly appears that this Medicine is not ſo <hi>innocent,</hi> and <hi>rare,</hi> as ſome, have extolled it to be: But on the contrary, it looks like a very ugly, <hi>unwholſome</hi> thing; very offenſive to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and much ingrateful to the <hi>Pallate:</hi> And upon this Conſideration, Dr. <hi>Helvet</hi> did Judg it not fit to be taken at the <hi>Mouth;</hi> but to be given only at the <hi>Poſteriors,</hi> by <hi>Clyſter;</hi> that it might do no Miſchief, to the more noble Parts.</p>
            <p>This way of uſing it by <hi>Clyſter,</hi> I own is not ſo bad; and if no better <hi>Remedy</hi> can be had, you muſt be contented to take it ſo: But when I conſider the <hi>Trouble</hi> that attends this way of receiving it; and the irkſome <hi>Repetitions</hi> thereof; with the <hi>uncertainty,</hi> of effecting the Purpoſe intended; I cannot applaud the Medicine, nor incourage the uſe of it ſo given. For this <hi>Author</hi> thus tells us.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The <hi>Clyſter</hi> (in <hi>Fevers</hi> intermitting) ought to be given juſt after the <hi>Fit;</hi> and to be repeated three times a Day, till the Patient is throughly well. <hi>P.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>In Continual Fevers give the <hi>Clyſter</hi> every fourth hour, till the Patient has loſt his <hi>Fever. P.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>A Child eighteen Months old, had a Fever, and recovered by <hi>twelve</hi> Clyſters. <hi>P.</hi> 42.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:33858:48"/>
               <p>One of eight years of Age: Another twelve years old, each of them took <hi>twenty-five,</hi> or <hi>thirty</hi> Clyſters, and were Cured. <hi>P.</hi> 42, and 43.</p>
               <p>One of eighteen Months old, another of ſix months old, recovered from tertian Fevers; by <hi>twenty</hi> Clyſters each. <hi>P.</hi> 44.</p>
               <p>One of eight years old in a <hi>Fever,</hi> with <hi>Colic</hi> Pains and Looſeneſs; took <hi>eighteen</hi> Clyſters and was well. Another ſeven years of Age in a malignant <hi>Fever,</hi> by the means of <hi>fifty Clyſters</hi> was perfectly Cured. <hi>P.</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>One aged ſeven years, and in a Fever, was Cured with <hi>thirty</hi> Clyſters. <hi>P.</hi> 48.</p>
               <p>One five years old, was Cured with <hi>forty</hi> Clyſters. <hi>Pa.</hi> 49.</p>
            </q>
            <p>This is a very troubleſome way of Curing, if it ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds well at the <hi>long</hi> run; after ſo many Times poking in the <hi>Breech.</hi> But to have all this trouble, and wait ſo long, and not be Cured hereby, is too bad; and, it proves too oft ſo. Yet this is not all the Trouble, and Charge, that attends this way of Curing; for you muſt make uſe of other Medicines alſo, as this <hi>Author</hi> appoints.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But I adviſe in the Time of taking their <hi>Clyſters,</hi> that they neglect not the uſe of <hi>Emeticks</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks.</hi> p. 18.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is very Cunningly adviſed; to hook in <hi>Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,</hi> and <hi>Parges,</hi> that they may be Aſſiſtants in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:33858:48"/>but the <hi>Bark</hi> muſt have all the Reputation, when a Cure is thus effected by <hi>joint</hi> Agents: And without the Help of other Medicines, it will not do. He therefore appoints ſeveral <hi>Cordiuls</hi> to be uſed, as the Accidents that attend the <hi>Ague</hi> do require; as you may ſee them ſet down in Page 18, 19, 20. of that ſecond Impreſſion.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Bark</hi> is magnified for a wonderful <hi>Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge</hi> by <hi>Clyſter;</hi> when other Medicines are introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to bear their <hi>Part,</hi> and form a <hi>Method:</hi> who can tell when a Cure is effected, which of them did moſt, or beſt? But with all the Aſſiſtance they can give with the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder,</hi> they prove but deceitful and uncertain Remedies; for which we have two noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Examples; one of the Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> not long ſince: And very lately, the ſeveral Accounts we have had, of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> long lingering, and often relapſing under an Intermitting Fever.</p>
            <p>If ſuch <hi>great</hi> Men are thus handled ignorantly, with deceitful frivolous Medicines; you may readily think, how meanly the middle, and lower Rank of People are provided for in Sickneſs. Doubtleſs their Phyſicians tryed the <hi>Bark</hi> to the <hi>utmoſt</hi> of their Skill; but how ineffectually, and ſhamefully, the Events did manifeſt. The <hi>Minera Morbi</hi> was remaining; which the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder</hi> could not remove; and from hence new Inſults of the Diſeaſe did ariſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til <hi>Nature</hi> by <hi>length</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> was able to ſpend, and overcome it.</p>

            <p>And now I muſt not conceal, what is much better, and a more certain Remedy for intermitting Fevers, (called Agues) Quotidian, Tertian, or Quartan: And that is the <hi>Catholic Extract;</hi> more eaſily mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, more pleaſant in the uſe of it; and more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious in performance of the deſired effects.

            <head>SECT. IX. <hi>The</hi> Practice <hi>upon</hi> Fevers <hi>Perniciouſly miſtaken.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>PRactice</hi> grounded upon falſe <hi>Doctrine,</hi> cannot be hopeful, or Safe: But there are ſome, and not a few; who miſtaking <hi>Fevers</hi> in the true Notion thereof; have a common Method of Cure, by <hi>Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Bliſtering,</hi> Juleping, and other ways of <hi>Cooling;</hi> to damp and ſuppreſs preternatural Heat: not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what this <hi>Heat</hi> is; from whence it proceeds, and the Principle thereof.</p>
            <p>There is nothing duly adminiſtred in <hi>Practice,</hi> without <hi>Indication</hi> to direct; what is properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be done. Fever <hi>quatenus</hi> Fever, barely and ſolely conſidered, as preternatural Heat, and only a Symptom of the Life ſo affected; requires no Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy adapt thereto; but only to that <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific <hi>Matter,</hi> which is the occaſional Cauſe, provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the <hi>Life,</hi> or vital Principle to aeſtuate.</p>
            <p>If ſo; as true it is, by the Diſcourſe and Reaſons preceding; then the <hi>Practice,</hi> is governed, by every ſuch Diſeaſe particularly; and <hi>Fever</hi> not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in Curing, otherwiſe than as <hi>ſignal;</hi> ſhewing the Life to be diſturb'd, and in a preternatural ſtate: But <hi>how,</hi> and with <hi>what,</hi> is not thereby appearing;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:33858:50"/>but to be ſought for, and inquired elſewhere, among the <hi>Cauſes;</hi> and you have no more to do with <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Curative</hi> means are to be appointed, as every <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> doth require: Then the Practice upon <hi>Fevers</hi> is out of Doors; and nothing to be done there; the Fears, and the buſtle about <hi>Fevers</hi> is vain, or rather pernicious. How abſurd it is, for any Man to ſay, He is Curing of a <hi>Fever;</hi> when he is Curing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe; he is buſie to no Purpoſe; or rather, he is doing of miſchief: For he is doing in the dark, and what can you expect from thence?</p>
            <p>To inſtitute a <hi>Practice</hi> for allaying of <hi>Fevers;</hi> to adapt rightly, ſafely, and hopefully therein; is to appoint, and go through, almoſt the whole <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>Phyſick:</hi> For moſt <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> have <hi>Fevers</hi> attending, and following after them; yet as dependants-remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly related thereto; and ariſing immediately from the Principle of Life. But if you will fix your Eye upon Fevers chiefly, and Characterize them with the Denomination, in all thoſe caſes; as deeming Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of greateſt Importance, and the Diſeaſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to be Cured: Then the Practice upon Fevers is very erroneous, and dangerous: But the Practice which ought to be in Fevers; is as various, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of Human Nature, are different from each other; and by their Cures, Fevers are cured <hi>(con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequenter)</hi> of courſe.</p>
            <p>Contrary to all this; I find a late Writer, who tells us of the <hi>Protean</hi> Nature of Fevers diſguiſed;
<q>
                  <hi>Sub larvâ Algoris funeſti, vomitionis indefinentis, Diarrheae torminoſae, Colicae Ventriculi, Hemicraniae
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:33858:50"/>periodicae, Apoplexiae, Syncopes, Rheumatiſmi, Spaſmi, univerſalis, Pluritidis, Peripneumoniae, vel alterius morbi ſecurè deliteſcens,</hi> — Dr. <hi>Morton Pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolog.</hi> p. 189.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He would have <hi>Fever,</hi> to act all theſe <hi>tragick</hi> Parts, and many more; as being variouſly diſguiſed and hid, under ſuch ſeveral Appearances; and their Cures to be included, in Curing the Fever. <hi>Cujus contrarium</hi> — He draws all the Practice upon <hi>Fevers;</hi> and I take all the Practice <hi>off</hi> from <hi>Fevers,</hi> and apply it elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Here I demand the Reaſon, why <hi>Fever</hi> or <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, which is but a <hi>Symptom;</hi> ſhould be exalted above the reſt of its fellow <hi>Symptoms,</hi> as moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; and be <hi>(Dux gregis)</hi> the Maſter ſymptom; or rather, as this <hi>Author</hi> would have it; to be <hi>Geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Symptomatum;</hi> the Father of a numerous off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and the <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>chiefeſt</hi> to be aimed at in Curing.</p>
            <p>The contrary whereof does appear; for as much as <hi>febrile</hi> Heat is the <hi>conſequent,</hi> occaſioned by ſuch various Diſorders, and preternatural Affects; not the <hi>Producer,</hi> or <hi>Leader</hi> of them. And therefore, they are of greater Importance, and threaten with more Danger, than <hi>Fever</hi> doth: Becauſe they are deſcended from, and do participate of <hi>Morbific</hi> cauſes, <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Miaſm</hi> in their Nature: But fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile Heat, is vital Heat; nearly allied to Human Nature, a <hi>Symptom</hi> of the Life; only exceeding na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper, provok'd thereto by ſuch <hi>morbific</hi> Cauſes.</p>

            <p>Now tell me where, and to what Curing is to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel at; when thoſe various <hi>Phenomena</hi> preſent? The ſame <hi>Author</hi> hath given an Anſwer; and directs our Aim at <hi>febrile</hi> Venom, or <hi>fermentum febrile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why <hi>fermentum febrile,</hi> and not <hi>fermentum emeticum, apoplecticum, Catharticum, Spaſmodicum, dolorificum, &amp;c?</hi> When the fermenting Matter or Miaſm, produceth ſuch <hi>Operations</hi> and <hi>Effects</hi> appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; why ſhould they not bear that <hi>Denomination,</hi> which is moſt ſignificant, and ſhewing the nature of the ferment, the <hi>Tendency,</hi> or <hi>motion</hi> thereof?</p>
            <p>If the fermenting Matter muſt have a Name; give it a proper Name, a diſtinguiſhing Name, that does indicate: But <hi>febrile,</hi> gives no information of the <hi>Matter,</hi> of what <hi>condition</hi> it is; therefore an impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and uſeleſs Title, as making no diſtinction. At this rate, a <hi>Stone</hi> in the Kidney may be called <hi>fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum febrile,</hi> becauſe it occaſions a <hi>Fever;</hi> but how fitly, let every one Judge: And all the Morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick cauſes in Aetiologia, may as unfitly be termed <hi>fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile Ferments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If cauſes that have been ſet forth ſo various, can be reduced under this <hi>one</hi> Head, <hi>Fermentum febrile;</hi> (few excepted) then the <hi>Practice</hi> of Phyſick, will be very conciſe and eaſie, now the <hi>Jeſuits Pouder,</hi> is ſo effectual againſt febrile <hi>venom,</hi> as ſome will have it to be. But I do not find the virtue of this <hi>Febrifuge</hi> ſo great; but will require much Aſſiſtance from other Means, in the performing of Cures: And we will go no farther for Proof hereof; than the Examplars
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:33858:52"/>ſet forth in <hi>Pyretologia</hi> of the ſame Author laſt named.</p>
            <p>After a long <hi>Harangue</hi> upon <hi>Fevers;</hi> ſhewing the Diverſity, Difficulty, and Dangers thereof: when we come to the <hi>Curing</hi> Part; there is nothing to be Cured, that properly and truly is called <hi>Fever;</hi> but ſomething elſe. They lay all the load upon <hi>Fever;</hi> charging the miſchief and Ruine, of Sickneſs and Diſeaſes upon <hi>Fever;</hi> and that is the <hi>leaſt</hi> Part of the Sickneſs.</p>
            <p>Then put the Saddle upon the right Horſe: The variety of <hi>Fevers,</hi> is the <hi>Diverſity</hi> of Diſeaſes; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der falſe <hi>Denominations,</hi> and the Umbrage of <hi>Fever.</hi> But by falſe Accuſations; <hi>Fever</hi> is a horrid and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Diſeaſe; being made the <hi>Epitome</hi> of Diſeaſes. <hi>Fever</hi> bears the Blame for all, but is wrongfully charg'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Inſons febris;</hi> Innocent <hi>Fever,</hi> a general ſignal of complaint; to let you know; that the <hi>Life</hi> or vital Principle, is uneaſie, injured or in Danger, and calls for Help; being impeded in Government, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd by <hi>Morbific</hi> Cauſes: Requiring ſuch Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as requiſite for the caſe; which may be as Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as Diſeaſes are numerous and different.</p>
            <p>Then let every ſuch <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Caſe,</hi> bear its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name; and not be Shrowded and mask'd, with a falſe Denomination of <hi>Fever;</hi> under a Pretence of the <hi>Protean</hi> Nature thereof: which if allowed; the <hi>Practice</hi> upon <hi>Fevers,</hi> will deceitfully be extended; and engroſs the greateſt Part of the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick: The conſequents whereof, muſt prove fatal.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:33858:53"/>
            <p>Obſerve what great <hi>Helmont</hi> ſaith:
<q>
                  <hi>Infebribus univerſis, eſt unica Archei accenſio ſive indignatio; unde &amp; in eſſentia, &amp; nomine febrili conveniunt: So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum autem per cauſam occaſionalem diſtinctae. De febr. cap.</hi> 13.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When the Life <hi>aeſtuates</hi> and complains; it is not without a cauſe; and you muſt find that cauſe out, and apply proper means there: Then you are in the <hi>right</hi> way of <hi>Curing;</hi> and there is no other ſafe, and hopeful way, to allay febrile Heat: Farther you need not trouble your ſelf about Fever.</p>
            <p>What <hi>Indication</hi> have you from Fever or febrile Heat? by the Galenic Rule of contraries, you will ſay, <hi>Cooling</hi> is <hi>indicated;</hi> but that is the ready way for killing in ſome Fevers; and in all other, fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly and injuriouſly uſed: Becauſe <hi>Indication</hi> for Cure in all febrile caſes, is taken for <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and their <hi>Cauſes;</hi> not from febrile Heat, a ſymptom of the Life. <hi>Fever</hi> therefore does but amuſe the World, and leads the unwary, and herein unknowing, out of the way for Curing.</p>
            <p>When a Perſon is <hi>wounded, fractur'd,</hi> or <hi>diſlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated;</hi> a Fever commonly ariſeth, as the conſequent of Pain: But this Fever makes no Curative <hi>Indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> gives no Direction for Curing the <hi>Wound, Fracture,</hi> or <hi>Diſlocation;</hi> and forbids nothing that ſuch caſes does require. The <hi>Chirurgical</hi> Means are <hi>indicated</hi> by thoſe ſeveral caſes; and the Surgeon is not to regard the Fever, but proceed by the true <hi>Indications</hi> according to <hi>Art.</hi> So likewiſe in all other Diſeaſes, and Cauſes: Becauſe febrile pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:33858:53"/>Heat, is but a Symptom of the Life hurt; not a Symptom of the Diſeaſe, or morbific Cauſe, <hi>immediate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whereas I have in this Diſcourſe, aſſerted <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> to be a <hi>Symptom,</hi> dependant upon Diſeaſes; my meaning is; a dependant remotely concern'd, and occaſionally procured: But properly, approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matly and intimately; <hi>preternatural</hi> Heat ariſeth from, and is dependant upon the <hi>Life,</hi> as its Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and an Emanation thereof.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Omnis Morbus indicat Remedium.</l>
               <l>Febris non indicat.</l>
               <l>Ergo, non eſt Morbus.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Major</hi> Propoſition, is the Doctrine of the <hi>Methodus Medendi,</hi> generally received, <hi>nemine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicente:</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> appears true, and fully proved, from the preceeding Reaſons, and needs not Repetition.</p>
            <p>Since Fever (being no <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> nor morbific <hi>Cauſe</hi>) does not indicate a Remedy; and is not to be regarded, as requiring <hi>Curative</hi> Means, directly pointing, and aiming thereto: Then why ſo much noiſe, and ſo much to do about <hi>Fevers?</hi> 'Tis all a great miſtake, and bluſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dark; giving falſe Names to Sickneſs; and adapting <hi>Curatives,</hi> where none are <hi>indicated,</hi> or <hi>required.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much in general, of <hi>male</hi> Practice upon Fevers: In the next Place, we will examine more
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:33858:54"/>particularly the Methods, and Means <hi>Chirurgical</hi> and <hi>Pharmaceutic,</hi> commonly appointed and uſed; as <hi>Bleeding, Bliſtering, Juleping,</hi> &amp;c. how they do properly anſwer their Intentions, as truly indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by <hi>Fevers:</hi> Or rather, how erroneous and wide, from what they ought to aim at.</p>

            </head>
            <p>UPON the Doctrine delivered, we are now to Inquire, how fitly <hi>Phlebotomy</hi> does anſwer, as a proper and ſutable <hi>Remedy,</hi> in the Cures of <hi>Fevers;</hi> being ſo generally uſed, and moſt commonly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the firſt place, as of right, to begin the Method of Curing.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Blood</hi> may well be accounted the Treaſury of Nature; for as this Store-Houſe is full or empty, with <hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad;</hi> the Perſon is chiefly adjudged to be in a <hi>good,</hi> or <hi>bad</hi> State; <hi>ut Signum &amp; Cauſa.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants from hence are ſo many, and ſo great; that much Caution and Circumſpection is to be uſed in the Diminution of it; not prodigally to be waſted upon ſlight, and ſeeming occaſions; but upon very urgent and neceſſitous Caſes.</p>
            <p>Some there are that appoint <hi>Bleeding;</hi> not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering ſo much an <hi>Indication</hi> for it, as the Cuſtom and preſent Faſhion of <hi>Phyſicians</hi> ſo to do: Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their <hi>Method</hi> of Cure not compleat, unleſs this come in courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Cauſes</hi> in Sickneſs are always to be principally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, and ſought for; where the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is, and from <hi>whence</hi> it ariſeth.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:33858:55"/>
            <p>If the cauſe of <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, does not lye in the <hi>Blood;</hi> as many <hi>Times,</hi> and more often it does not: Then <hi>Bleeding</hi> is vain, and gives no Relief in ſuch caſes; but rather Hurt, by debilitating Nature.</p>
            <p>Diſeaſes take their <hi>Riſe,</hi> more frequently from the <hi>Stomach,</hi> than any other Part of the Body. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>firſt,</hi> and chiefeſt <hi>office</hi> of Elaboration for ſupplying the whole Body: And being the <hi>Seat</hi> of the <hi>Life</hi> more eminently, where the Power of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is diſtributed, and does virtually or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluentially preſide over the reſt: There you may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to find the <hi>Origine</hi> of Diſeaſes <hi>moſtly,</hi> or more <hi>often.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Defects and Inſufficient Performance of that <hi>Office,</hi> lays the <hi>Foundation</hi> of moſt complaints; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by <hi>Tranſmiſſion</hi> of ill matter; by <hi>Conſent;</hi> or <hi>Debility</hi> of Influx, to enable the ſeveral Parts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, for acting their Duties.</p>
            <p>Curing muſt begin, where <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> have their <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</hi> What advantage then will <hi>Bleeding</hi> afford, when the <hi>Stomach</hi> requires rectifying, and corrobora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting? no Benefit, but much harm thereby.</p>
            <p>All <hi>Remedies</hi> are, or ought to be; adapted to <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes</hi> and their <hi>Cauſes:</hi> Fever is no Diſeaſe, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proved) but a <hi>dependant</hi> upon Diſeaſes; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>bleeding</hi> in Fevers, for Fevers ſake only; is er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly inſtituted.</p>
            <p>Inquire into ſome of the Diſeaſes that commonly have <hi>Fevers</hi> attending them. As when a Fever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:33858:55"/>from a <hi>Surfeit</hi> and over-charge of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> from too much received; or ſomething diſagreeing, and not digeſting, but oppreſſing. Such caſes are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry frequent; for moſt Sick People complain at the <hi>Stomach;</hi> of <hi>Nauſeouſneſs, Fulneſs,</hi> or <hi>Heavineſs</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi> Now what can <hi>Bleeding</hi> do in ſuch like Complaints? How ſhall the <hi>Stomach</hi> receive any Benefit thereby? Bleeding empties the <hi>Veins,</hi> but it does not diſcharge the <hi>Stomach</hi> of <hi>peccant</hi> Matter: does not cleanſe and roborate that principal Part: Therefore is no Curing Means in ſuch Caſes.</p>
            <p>A Fit of the <hi>Stone</hi> produceth a <hi>Fever.</hi> And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the <hi>Gout</hi> with continued <hi>Pain,</hi> hath a Fever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Colic</hi> alſo will procure <hi>febrile</hi> Heat.</p>
            <p>Obſtructions of the <hi>Spleen,</hi> cauſing <hi>Pain</hi> in that Part, raiſeth a Fever: And all other <hi>Pains</hi> of the <hi>Bowels</hi> continuing, begets a Fever.</p>
            <p>Now inquire rightly into the true Cauſes of all theſe <hi>Pains;</hi> you will not find the <hi>Blood</hi> ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd, as the Cauſe thereof, for to let it out.</p>
            <p>You are to diſtinguiſh a Fever, ariſing from the <hi>vitioſity</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> as the continent Cauſe of <hi>Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> in the ſmaller <hi>venal</hi> Pipes, which is rare: And a <hi>febrile</hi> Diſtemper Communicated to the <hi>Blood,</hi> which is frequent; occaſioned from ſome remote Cauſe, diſturbing the vital Stream by Superfermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <pb n="100" facs="tcp:33858:56"/>
            <p>When the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Fever is in the <hi>Blood</hi> Veſſels, you have then ſome pretence to appoint <hi>Phlebotomy:</hi> But when the cauſe of Fever is <hi>extraneous,</hi> and not in thoſe <hi>Tubes</hi> of conveyance; the Blood affected by <hi>Conſent</hi> only, from the diſturbance elſewhere: in all ſuch caſes, and which do commonly preſent; there is no occaſion to uſe the <hi>Lancet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In all Sickneſs, and Diſeaſes whatever; the <hi>Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> or <hi>Strength</hi> of Nature, is to be kept up: Then 'tis a Crime to waſte it prodigally, when no Benefit does accrue thereby.</p>
            <p>It is denoted to us in Sacred Writt; That <hi>in the Blood, is the Life.</hi> Then it neceſſarily follows; ſo much <hi>Blood</hi> let out by opening a Vein; ſo much of the <hi>Life</hi> is gone; and ſo much <hi>Strength</hi> abated.

And now ſuch Practiſers do think, and make others believe, they have conquered the <hi>Fever:</hi> But more truly it may be ſaid, they conquered <hi>Nature,</hi> and laid her flat: For, tho' the <hi>Heat</hi> be abated, the <hi>morbific</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not <hi>leſſened</hi> by Bleeding: That Spirit of Life, which warms and preſerves natural Heat in <hi>Health;</hi> is the ſame that aeſtuates and grows hotter in <hi>Sickneſs.</hi> So that aiming only, or chiefly to allay <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, after this manner; is endeavouring to ſuppreſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the <hi>Life;</hi> not the Diſeaſe: For, <hi>cauſa peccans in febri, non calet ex ſe; ſed tantum excitativè &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionaliter;</hi> provoking the <hi>Life</hi> to aeſtuate, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurge againſt an inbred enemy.</p>

Then we may reaſonably think; the more vigorous and ſtrong Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is; the better will be the Event.

            <p>The Blood (after it hath ſtood ſome time) thus preſenting to the Eye ſo depraved; they ſtraitway undoubtingly conclude; it was diſcreetly and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily taken away for the <hi>Patient</hi>'s good: Thinking hereby, ſo much <hi>matter</hi> of the Diſeaſe is abated, and let out.

            <p>But all this while they are not aware of the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> they are under, in this Proſecution: For they do not conſider the different <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Blood,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power and Protection of the <hi>Life,</hi> in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per native Place, the <hi>Veins</hi> and <hi>Arteries;</hi> and how apt it is to change, and variouſly to degenerate, when <hi>extravaſated</hi> and expoſed to the <hi>Air;</hi> The Blood is not the ſame now 'tis exhibited to the <hi>View,</hi> as it was in the <hi>Veſſels</hi> of conſervation.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Life</hi> was in the <hi>Blood</hi> before; but now in the Porringer, it is <hi>dead</hi> Blood. Between the <hi>Dead</hi> and the <hi>Living,</hi> there muſt needs be great diſparity, ſo that the Judgment paſſed upon the <hi>dead</hi> Blood; does not affect, or repreſent the <hi>live Blood;</hi> for it is not, what it was.

            <p>I do not deny the <hi>Blood</hi> of ſeveral Perſons, to differ in <hi>Purity</hi> and Goodneſs; and the difference thereof in the ſame Perſons; as they are in a good, or bad ſtate of <hi>Health:</hi> But I do not approve of the ſevere raſh Judgment pronounced upon the Blood extramitted, from the <hi>dead Aſpect</hi> thereof: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding from thence, it was fit for no other uſe but to be thrown away; and better to be out, than in the Body.</p>
            <p>True it is, there are ſome Diſeaſes, that the <hi>Blood</hi> is much in <hi>fault,</hi> as the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of ſuch Maladies; yet notwithſtanding, that is not a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Cauſe to let it out: ſince there are efficacious <hi>purifying</hi> Remedies, to reduce the Blood into a <hi>better</hi> Condition; and not prodigally to waſte that <hi>vital</hi> Stream, ſo neceſſarily uſeful, and ſerviceable to the whole Body. For, the Maſs of <hi>Blood</hi> is not depraved and amended by <hi>Phlebotomy,</hi> let out as much as you will; equal Parts of good and bad, will remain behind, from this <hi>promiſcuous</hi> evacuation.</p>

            <p>According to this great <hi>Author,</hi> the <hi>Seat</hi> of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, both Continual and Intermitting, is not in the <hi>Veins,</hi> or <hi>Arteries;</hi> but in the firſt <hi>Region</hi> of the Body, from whence they take their Riſe: Then what ſignifies <hi>Bleeding</hi> in ſuch caſes, but to add more miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. Their Cures are performed by <hi>Abſterſives,</hi> and <hi>Depuratives;</hi> to cleanſe where ſuch <hi>morbific</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is bred: And thoſe are the true <hi>Antifebrific</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies. And not only ſuch; but they are alſo <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal</hi> Medicines, required as neceſſary in all other Cures.</p>
            <p>I do allow of <hi>Bleeding,</hi> upon ſome ſuddain great <hi>Inflammation,</hi> that threatens the Life; and when efficacious diſcuſſing Means are wanted, to prevent <hi>Apoſtomation:</hi> But otherwiſe, if it come o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:33858:60"/>and ſlowly, giving warning; and good <hi>Medicine</hi> ready for uſe at Hand; then <hi>bleeding</hi> is not required, and better to forbear the Lancet.</p>
            <p>Some are ſo bold at <hi>Bleeding,</hi> that they forbear not in the higheſt <hi>Malignant</hi> Fevers, Small <hi>Pox,</hi> &amp;c. But if the Sick recover, 'tis wonderful Providence that ſaves them; but more oft <hi>Death</hi> is procured thereby. In the expectance of the Small <hi>Pox,</hi> they will <hi>Bleed,</hi> under Pretence of abating the corrupt <hi>Matter</hi> that breaks forth; thinking thereby, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient</hi> may not be ſo much disfigured with <hi>Puſtles:</hi> and may be a Help to preſerve the <hi>Face</hi> from Deformity, which before was beautiful.</p>
            <p>The end propoſed was good; but the <hi>Medium</hi> they go by, is very dangerous, and unlikely to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed well: For ſaving a Face, to hazard the Life, is no good deſigning. They begin at the wrong end of ſuch malignant Diſtempers; for by Bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they aim at, and apply only to the Effects, the producted Matter; and neglect the produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Cauſe, the Venemous Miaſm, or fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Leven, that corrupts the whole Maſs of Blood.</p>
            <p>To prevent Impurity, and Corruption of the Blood, is much better, than to leſſen and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the Quantity of the Blood, after it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The main deſign in ſuch caſes; is firſt how to expel the putrefying venom, before it ſpreads and taints the whole; at leaſt ſo to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify Nature, that ſhe may be able to Maſter it, and defend her ſelf.</p>
            <pb n="109" facs="tcp:33858:60"/>
            <p>The Indications for Cure are theſe; to aſſiſt and ſtrengthen the Life, that ſhe may be able to reſiſt the Venom: And to Mortifie the malign Ferment, by proper Alexipharmacals; thereby to preſerve the vital ſtreams from mortal Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, or Coagulation. But bleeding is quite contrary to this Method, and Intentions for Cure; and is the ready way for killing.</p>
            <p>That which makes a promiſcuous evacuation of good and bad together; is no true Remedy for Curing: Phlebotomy does not diſtinguiſh the better Part of the Blood, from the worſe; but lets both out together; the remainder in the Veſſels, is not amended thereby; but equal Proportions continue behind of good and bad.</p>
            <p>Therefore abating the Quantity of naughty Blood, in any caſe by bleeding, is an indirect way to amend it: and conſequently an unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table attempt for Curing: But in Fevers Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnant, a moſt dangerous Practice, to weaken Nature by letting out the Balſam of Life; and thereby retracting inwards, what ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded outwards, to the univerſal covering Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane; and from thence to be ſent away by Tranſpiration.</p>
            <p>The chiefeſt Pretence for bleeding is Pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; if you can be aſſured, that the Blood-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels are full to diſtention, and over-loading Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; as when ſome Cuſtomary Evacuation is ſtopt, that ought to be free; and the Body
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:33858:61"/>does ſuperabound with Blood, Being convinced thereof by evident Signs; it may lawfully then be diminiſhed by the Lancet; if no Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indication at that time forbids; determined at the Diſcretion of a Judicious Phyſician, in ſuch du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious Caſes.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN the Cure of <hi>Fevers,</hi> 'tis now become a great Mode amongſt <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> even thoſe reputed of the firſt <hi>Rank;</hi> to appoint <hi>Veſicatory</hi> Plaſters, as a neceſſary Help to allay <hi>Fevers.</hi> This Invention is moſt frequently uſed, as urgently required in their Methods of Curing. What <hi>Benefit</hi> may ariſe hereby; or rather what <hi>Hurt</hi> from thence procured, we ſhall now ſtrictly inquire into that Practice.</p>
            <p>For the better managing whereof; more clearly, ſatisfactorily, and to avoid <hi>Repetitions;</hi> I ſhall exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine this <hi>Matter</hi> upon different <hi>Heads</hi> diſtinctly; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring particularly as followeth.</p>
            <p>Firſt; Into the Nature of the <hi>Ingredients,</hi> of which <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> or bliſtering Plaſters are compoſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly; After what <hi>Manner</hi> they perform their Operations.</p>
            <p>Thirdly; For what <hi>Intentions</hi> they are uſed.</p>
            <p>Fourthly; Whether they do <hi>attract</hi> Morbific Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; or <hi>make</hi> ill Matter, where none was.</p>
            <pb n="112" facs="tcp:33858:62"/>
            <p>Fifthly; Whether their Operations be <hi>auxiliary,</hi> and <hi>pleaſing</hi> to Nature; or otherwiſe, <hi>diſturbing</hi> and <hi>croſſing</hi> her endeavours to help her ſelf.</p>
            <p>For Satisfaction to the firſt <hi>Head</hi> or <hi>Diviſion;</hi> you muſt know, that in the Diſtribution of Simples which have ſome Affinity, and ranked under proper <hi>Claſſes;</hi> there are a ſort termed <hi>Pyrotics;</hi> ſo deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated from their Nature, being hot and fiery as the word imports.</p>
            <p>Of theſe <hi>Pyrotics</hi> there is a gradual difference; and therefore they have ſeveral Names: <hi>Veſicatories, Catharetics, Septics,</hi> and <hi>Cauſtics.</hi> All of them, more or leſs; bliſtering, burning potentially, putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, corroding, exulcerating and conſuming: ſome whereof are very <hi>malign,</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> to the Life. In appointing and making of <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> Practiſers do differ by electing and compounding variouſly this and that together: But every ſuch Compoſition, that performs the Intention of Bliſtering, muſt have ſome of the forenamed <hi>Pyrotics.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Then it appears from hence, how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſuch Effects; <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Quality</hi> extreme, in the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> Degree; and by <hi>malign venemous</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, <hi>tota ſubſtantia,</hi> hurtful and deſtructive to Human Bodies: As alſo inimical and hoſtile to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, the <hi>Life;</hi> they acting as <hi>venoms.</hi> This Account is given (by good Authors) of the ſimple Ingredients of ſuch external Medicines, and they operate <hi>per ſe,</hi> as ſuch.</p>
            <pb n="113" facs="tcp:33858:62"/>
            <p n="3">3. The Purpoſes for which <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> Bliſtering Plaſters are uſed ſo frequently in Practice; and the Benefits expected, or prefended from them, are theſe.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe <hi>Intentions</hi> are advantageous, and very good; but the <hi>Mediums</hi> they go by to arrive thither; the <hi>Means</hi> uſed to effect ſuch deſigns; I doubt, are not <hi>ſuteable</hi> and <hi>probable</hi> to anſwer; as will appear fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>

We are now to inquire; whether <hi>Veſicatories</hi> do draw the <hi>Morbific</hi> Matter from <hi>Parts</hi> remote, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected therewith: or do <hi>make</hi> ill Matter, in <hi>ſound</hi> Places; whereto ſuch <hi>Plaſters</hi> are applied: And here alſo we ſhall examine the <hi>Probability,</hi> or <hi>Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> of that Invention, to abate and draw out the Heat of Fevers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pain</hi> being a Common Cauſe of <hi>Fevers;</hi> always rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or continuing a <hi>Fever,</hi> if the <hi>Pain</hi> be great: Then Bliſtering <hi>Plaſters,</hi> that add more <hi>Pain</hi> to the <hi>Patient</hi> Sufferer; are very unlikely means to allay a <hi>Fever;</hi> but on the contrary more like to aggravate, and augment the <hi>febrile</hi> Heat: For, the Ingredients of ſuch <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> are very <hi>hot</hi> in their Nature and Operations; and ſo <hi>hot,</hi> as to <hi>bliſter</hi> the Skin, as if <hi>burn'd,</hi> or <hi>ſcalded.</hi> Thus here is adding <hi>Heat,</hi> to <hi>Heat.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="114" facs="tcp:33858:63"/>
            <p>And conſider; that <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, is <hi>vital</hi> Heat; you are to eſteem it ſo, and treat it as ſuch; fairly to reduce it into Moderation, and Natural Temper; by ſubducting the <hi>irritating</hi> Cauſes, that provokes the <hi>Life</hi> to <hi>aeſtuate, and be diſquiet. But by apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing venomous, ſcorching, bliſtering</hi> plaſters; they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther give a <hi>diſturbance,</hi> than <hi>Pacify;</hi> and the Life is more uneaſie, and incenſed thereby.</p>
            <p>From hence it does appear, that <hi>Veſicatories</hi> appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to aſſwage <hi>Fevers</hi> is a vain attempt; and rather <hi>Fomenters,</hi> than <hi>Mitigators</hi> of febrile Heat; which is <hi>vital</hi> Heat preternaturally graduated.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, you will find as much Improbabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of operating upon the <hi>occaſional cauſing</hi> Matter; as upon the <hi>producted</hi> Heat: For, thoſe <hi>veſicatory</hi> Plaſters, if I grant, they have an attraction of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral Matter; it is <hi>promiſcuous</hi> only, not <hi>elective</hi> and peculiar, of this or that Morbific Humor, at your pleaſure and appointment.</p>
            <p>What probable good Reaſon can you give, for dragging of <hi>Morbous</hi> Matter, or <hi>Miaſm,</hi> from cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral remote Parts, to the <hi>cutany</hi> Circumference, by unknown difficult ways (if it could ſo be) when more likely, ready and convenient <hi>Paſſages</hi> there are; to convey and diſcharge, by known <hi>Ductures,</hi> fabricated by Nature for that Purpoſe?</p>
            <p>True it is; that a good <hi>Diuphoretic</hi> Medicine, does ſend forth <hi>(expulſive)</hi> from the <hi>Center</hi> to the <hi>Circumference</hi> directly, and linealy, with much Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, in caſes ſo requiring; ſuch as Fevers, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:33858:63"/>the <hi>Malign,</hi> that moſtly ſtand in need of that <hi>Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and Help. And this is frequently, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly performed, becauſe <hi>Nature</hi> is prompt and comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therewith; (this being an <hi>Operation</hi> of her own <hi>Inſtitution</hi>) opening upon ſuch <hi>Occaſions,</hi> all her Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inviſible porous <hi>Paſſages</hi> for a free tranſmiſſion and cureſs, on all ſides. <hi>Totum Gorpus eſt perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This work <hi>Nature</hi> does willingly perform, with the Aſſiſtance, and Provocation by good <hi>internal</hi> Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But to <hi>virulent</hi> bliſtering, painful <hi>Plaſters;</hi> Nature is not ſo obedient, and complying therewith; does not <hi>dilate</hi> and open her imperceptible <hi>vents</hi> of Communication, Tranſmiſſion, and Perſpiration, to ſuch <hi>irkſom, injurious,</hi> and <hi>improper</hi> Applications.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid, I rationally conclude: That ſuch Humor diſcharged by the <hi>Bliſters,</hi> is no far-fetcht Matter; not from the Diſeaſed <hi>Part</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily affected, the <hi>Seat</hi> of the Diſeaſe <hi>far</hi> off, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a Fever: But it is only a <hi>putrid</hi> Water, from a <hi>colliquation</hi> of the Fleſh; and a depraved Alteration of the nutricious <hi>Juices,</hi> of the <hi>Part</hi> applied to, ſo converted by the <hi>virulent</hi> corroſive Nature of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicatory</hi> Plaſter.</p>
            <p>And yet notwithſtanding; thoſe <hi>Phyſicians</hi> have believed (at leaſt they would have <hi>Patients</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve) that it is <hi>morbiſic febrile</hi> Matter, attracted thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Skin <hi>(è longinquo)</hi> by virtue of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical Medicine; <hi>(credat qui volet)</hi> which is againſt all Reaſon: For; this <hi>bliſtering</hi> Plaſter, ſhall make the ſame <hi>ichorous</hi> Water iſſue from the <hi>ſound</hi> and healthful; as from the <hi>ſick feveriſh</hi> Perſon: So that
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:33858:64"/>I am well ſatisfied; this <hi>Water</hi> thus extracted, was not morbific <hi>pre-exiſting;</hi> but <hi>factitious</hi> Matter, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted by the external Medicine; and ſo vented by bliſtering.</p>
            <p>Medicines are to aim, and level at <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> where they are <hi>ſeated;</hi> and to diſcharge their Power there, as well and truly deſigned: If ſo, then theſe <hi>Veſicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> muſt draw away the <hi>febrile</hi> Matter from the <hi>Heart; (ſedes Morbi,</hi> according to their Definition of Fever). But if thoſe <hi>corroſive</hi> Plaſters, ſhall ſend their <hi>virulent</hi> virtue to the <hi>Heart;</hi> the Patient then, muſt be very <hi>Heart-ſick</hi> with that Operation. And grant it ſhould extend thither; <hi>(quod non eſt ſupponen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum)</hi> How ſhall the peccant <hi>Matter</hi> find the way out, from the <hi>Center</hi> to the <hi>Circumference;</hi> this being an obſcure impaſſable way; at leaſt, not to be found, unleſs by the extraordinary ſecret conduct of Nature; who (as I ſaid before) is not pleaſed, nor comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this irkſom <hi>bliſtering</hi> Invention. <hi>(Invitâ Naturâ, irrita ſunt omnia. Ax.)</hi> Wherefore, no good can be expected from them, in Curing Fevers.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sickneſs</hi> when Nature does protrude, and ſend forth any ill Matter to the extern Parts, appearing upon the <hi>Skin;</hi> it is a good ſign ſhe will be victorious, having diſlodged Morbific Matter from within, and ſafely brought it to the confines of the Body; as in the eruption of the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> And alſo, when Nature does ſhew any tendency that way, by breathing Sweat; it behoves the Phyſician to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, and help forward with wholeſom internal Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <pb n="117" facs="tcp:33858:64"/>
            <p>But if you think by <hi>bliſtering,</hi> to prompt, or put Nature upon <hi>expulſion</hi> that way; you rather diſtract, and diſturb her good Inclination, than put forward that beneficial Operation, for the Reaſons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
            <p>'Tis a great <hi>Errour;</hi> ſo formally and conſtantly, to appoint <hi>Veſicatories;</hi> as neceſſary to compleat the Methods for Curing Fevers: As if Nature had not ſufficiently provided other ways, to diſcharge Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific Matter; and this were the principal way inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and not to be neglected.</p>
            <p>When a Perſon is <hi>Sick,</hi> oppreſſed at the <hi>Stomach;</hi> a Fever commonly ariſeth from ſuch complaints: And this ſort of Sickneſs, from <hi>Fulneſs</hi> or <hi>Foulneſs;</hi> is moſt frequent. What have you to do with <hi>bliſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in ſuch Caſes? Can you draw this oppreſſing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted, or depraved Matter, out of the <hi>Stomach</hi> by Veſicatories: Or if they had ſuch a power of <hi>Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> as to bring it forth to the Skin; is it not very unfit and unreaſonable; to draw ſuch foul Matter, and often very groſs Matter, directly through the <hi>Habit</hi> of the Body, and leaving <hi>Dregs</hi> in the Paſſage; when other patent ways, are ready to tranſmit it, upwards or downwards, by Natures Deſign and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
            <p>To avoid this Cenſure in part; perhaps they will, ſay; we intend to carry off the vitious Matter, by <hi>Purging,</hi> or <hi>Vomiting;</hi> the Veſicatories are to draw out the <hi>Fever,</hi> and keep that under.</p>
            <pb n="118" facs="tcp:33858:65"/>
            <p>I don't like your Policy; for this erroneous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>bliſtering,</hi> is but <hi>bluſtering</hi> in the dark; and proceeds from groſs Ignorance; having a falſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Fever;</hi> what <hi>febrile</hi> Heat is, and from whence it does ariſe. Take away the Morbific <hi>Matter</hi> by unloading the <hi>Stomach;</hi> ſet that right by cleanſing, and roborating with good internal Medicine; and then the whole work is done; that you need not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble your ſelf, or the Patient, about the <hi>Fever;</hi> that abates and goes away of courſe, as you diſcharge the <hi>Stomach</hi> from the offending Cauſe.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe; a Fit of the <hi>Colic,</hi> or <hi>Stone,</hi> raiſeth a <hi>Fever;</hi> and this <hi>Fever</hi> not to be regarded: But proper Medicines to be uſed, only reſpecting the Stone, or Colic.</p>
            <p>An hundred other <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>Caſes</hi> we might name; wherewith <hi>Fevers</hi> are attended; but not to be conſidered otherwiſe, than as <hi>ſignal;</hi> ſhewing that the Life is diſturb'd, and incenſed by ſome Morbific <hi>Matter,</hi> or <hi>Cauſe</hi> in this, or that part of the Body: Find that <hi>Cauſe</hi> out; <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>where</hi> the offending Matter is; and proſecute <hi>there</hi> only with good Means: The <hi>Fever</hi> needs no other Cure; than the Cure of that <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> which cauſed the Life to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, to aeſtuate and grow hot.</p>
            <p>Upon the Appearance of a <hi>Fever,</hi> Phyſicians are much, and over much concern'd; ſtraightway fall on upon the <hi>Fever</hi> with <hi>bleeding, bliſtering,</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leps,</hi> to ſuppreſs and keep that under; to ſecure that Bugbear in the firſt place; as chiefly threatning the Life of the Patient. The Sick and their Relations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:33858:65"/>very apprehenſive of the Danger; how many have died by Fevers, (as commonly; but falſly ſaid) reſign up freely to the <hi>Doctor</hi>'s great Skill; and Care herein; ſubmitting to the <hi>Risk</hi> of all the male Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, in <hi>bleeding, bliſtering,</hi> &amp;c. the ready way to Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>After this manner, ſlight and trivial Sickneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes <hi>long,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>hazardous</hi> Sickneſs; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times <hi>mortal.</hi> And I do account it a ſpecial Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that delivers out of ſuch perilous Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Sickneſs</hi> we are always to obſerve the <hi>Inclination</hi> and <hi>Tendency</hi> of Nature; which way ſhe thinks beſt, and moſt expeditely to diſcharge Morbific Matter, according to the Precept of <hi>Hippocrates, Quò Natura vergit, conducere oportet.</hi> And that is ſometimes by the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> by <hi>Expectoration,</hi> by erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Blood</hi> at the <hi>Noſe, per <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>terum,</hi> and by the <hi>Skin:</hi> Not to thwart and croſs her endeavours; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſhe be forced into a wrong courſe by ſtimulating Matter, and thereby becomes apparently extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant therein: As when a <hi>Symptomatical</hi> Flux <hi>per Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vum</hi> is extream, then to mitigate and allay it, by good internal Means; but not by <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract injuriouſly, a <hi>contrary</hi> way.</p>
            <p>If the cauſe of Fever be <hi>(in primis viis)</hi> in the firſt Region of the Body; as moſt frequently it is; then 'tis great Imprudence, to attempt drawing <hi>outwards</hi> by <hi>Veſicatories,</hi> when other Ways, and convenient Ductures are open to tranſmit it. When <hi>Nature</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines, and ſhews a diſpoſition to free her ſelf by the <hi>Guts;</hi> 'tis very injurious to divert her Intentions, by
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:33858:66"/>attracting <hi>outwards,</hi> and endeavouring to vent by the <hi>Skin;</hi> drawing a contrary way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Si Materia turgeat,</hi> ſays <hi>Hippocrates:</hi> If the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific Matter ferments and ſwells for vent; let it go that way moſt expedite, and inclinable thereto: by <hi>Stool,</hi> by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> bleeding at the <hi>Noſe,</hi> &amp;c. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Nature hath a Tendency, and is prompt for evacuation by the <hi>Skin;</hi> which is advantageous, and to be promoted by good Means. But I do not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count <hi>bliſtering</hi> in the Number of good Means to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote that Operation; except ſome Matter be collecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a particular <hi>Place</hi> under the <hi>Skin,</hi> and wants ſome Help to bring it forth: Then a <hi>Veſicatory</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, or Cupping, is rational and good.</p>
            <p>But when Nature makes a <hi>critical</hi> effort, by the <hi>Skin</hi> generally <hi>(per Diaphoreſin)</hi> breathes out <hi>eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To apply <hi>Veſicatories</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Fevers;</hi> is to compel Nature to diſcharge that way, which perhaps ſhe hath no <hi>Intention</hi> to do; and no <hi>occaſion</hi> for it, but rather another way. But if there be an Inclination, and good occaſion to operate that way; it is more ſafe and better, to aſſiſt and promote with <hi>internal</hi> Means, that certainly roborates and expels <hi>(à Centro undique)</hi> every way outwards to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Parts: Much rather, than truſt to <hi>dubious</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting <hi>external</hi> Means <hi>(in puncto circumferentiae)</hi> upon a narrow <hi>Spot,</hi> that gives no Ability to ſend forth; but painfully and doggedly coerceth, <hi>nolens volens:</hi> and that's the beſt of it, if <hi>attractive</hi> power be granted.</p>

               <hi>Fever</hi> ſuppoſed to be the Diſeaſe (not known but by its Name) and is only a general <hi>Symptom,</hi> of all fierce <hi>Diſtempers</hi> and dolorous <hi>Diſeaſes;</hi> being appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to the <hi>ſtanders</hi> by, and confirm'd by Sentence of the <hi>Phyſician;</hi> takes up moſt of their Thoughts, in deſigning how to Maſter, and Secure this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy, that ſtands foremoſt in view: And as their Eyes are moſt, and chiefly upon the <hi>Fever;</hi> ſo their <hi>Fears</hi> are from thence, and their <hi>Endeavours</hi> are bent, to abate and ſuppreſs the <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, at the firſt Appearance thereof: But when this preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Aeſtuation</hi> is raiſed to a Degree; all Helps are then thought of, to damp and extinguſh this kindling <hi>Flame,</hi> as great and threatning <hi>Danger</hi> from thence; which <hi>byaſſeth</hi> the Phyſician from his right <hi>Aim,</hi> at the <hi>morbific</hi> Cauſe of all this Diſturbance.</p>
            <p>From hence ariſeth all the Inventions of <hi>Cooling,</hi> ſo frequently uſed in <hi>Fevers: Juleps, Emulſions, Pti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans,</hi> cooling <hi>Apozems, Embrocations,</hi> &amp;c. which make a great clutter of <hi>Gallipots,</hi> and <hi>Glaſſes</hi> about

            <p>The deſign for Cure therefore, in all Caſes when a <hi>Fever</hi> appears; is to find out <hi>where;</hi> and <hi>what</hi> the Matter is, that diſquiets and provokes the <hi>Life</hi> to be hot, and exceed its natural Temper: And to ſuch <hi>Cauſes</hi> the Phyſician ſhould bend his <hi>Endeavours;</hi> and the <hi>Medicines</hi> to level againſt the <hi>Diſturbers</hi> of the Life. Not regarding <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, otherwiſe than as <hi>ſignal,</hi> and which requires no means directed thither, but to the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> only, that cauſeth the <hi>Life</hi> to aeſtuate.</p>
            <p>What Advantage can you expect from <hi>Juleps,</hi> or other <hi>Coolers</hi> in any Caſe of a Fever? Since they Cure no <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> nor do they ſeem as likely means. Will a <hi>Julep</hi> Cure the <hi>Gout, Stone, Pleuriſy, Colic, Spleen,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:33858:68"/>any other Diſeaſe, upon which <hi>Fevers</hi> do depend? And if not; then vain are the uſe of theſe <hi>Cooling</hi> Inventions, and fruſtraneous.</p>
            <p>But the doing of no <hi>good;</hi> that's not all the loſs by <hi>Juleps;</hi> for they do much <hi>miſchief:</hi> As when the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <hi>Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> heats and ſtrives to expel morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic <hi>Cauſes;</hi> thereby ſhewing the endeavours, and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of vital ſtrength: <hi>Juleps</hi> may then damp this <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> Heat, and diſable <hi>Nature;</hi> but they remove no peccant Matter: They check and oppreſs the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> that is too flat and dull in Fevers; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires then, ſomething to whet and ſharpen the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> thereof: But inſtead of ſuch an aſſiſting Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; they ply the Sick with injurious <hi>Coolers,</hi> that act againſt the Fortitude and Endeavours of <hi>Nature;</hi> and giving no Satisfaction to the languiſhing Patient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of other Drink.</p>
            <p>How many <hi>thirſty</hi> Sick Perſons, have long'd, and earneſtly beg'd for a Draught of <hi>Beer?</hi> But was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied to them, becauſe the <hi>Doctors</hi> forbad it, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed <hi>Julep, Barley water</hi> and ſuch Stuff. After this manner <hi>Thouſands,</hi> or I may ſay, <hi>Millions</hi> have been kill'd, by the Ignorance of their Undertakers for Curing. The faint <hi>ſick</hi> Man cannot <hi>eat;</hi> and his <hi>Phyſician</hi> will not let him <hi>Drink,</hi> what he likes, and is moſt likely to do him good: We may rationally judge, that Sick <hi>People</hi> cannot live long under ſuch Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>But this is not all the <hi>miſchief</hi> yet: For, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards of this <hi>Juleping,</hi> and <hi>Cooling</hi> Practice, will further appear; if we conſider the Frequency, La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, and Danger of this <hi>Series</hi> and Tranſition; of

            <p>This latent dangerous <hi>Train,</hi> more frequently lurking, than diſcovered; not <hi>ſuſpecting,</hi> or <hi>ſought</hi> for; hath brought more to the <hi>Grave,</hi> than any <hi>commutation,</hi> or <hi>complication</hi> of Diſeaſes whatever. For tho' there be a great Number of <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> (mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied by <hi>Names</hi>) whereunto Human Nature is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and many of them do come, and go off again in the courſe of Life, <hi>facile curabiles;</hi> yet moſt, if not all the <hi>Contumacious,</hi> are therein concern'd; and ſuch as become <hi>Mortal;</hi> do terminate in this <hi>Series,</hi> as the <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> and laſt Scene.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mortal</hi> Diſeaſes I ſaid; becauſe, when this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Train</hi> of Diſeaſes, is ſtopt in its Progreſs, and hath not its full <hi>courſe,</hi> but taken off, and prevented by effectual good <hi>Means,</hi> or great <hi>Providence;</hi> and then <hi>Pain</hi> may exerciſe its Power ſingly, and alone for a Time, by Intervals: Or Pain may contract and aſſociate a <hi>Tumor;</hi> ſometimes an <hi>Inflammation;</hi> and yet all this may end well; theſe may go off again, or be ſent off by Medicine, and proceed no further; the Patient may recover, and return to a good ſtate of Health.</p>
            <p>But too often it proves otherwiſe; by <hi>neglect</hi> and Delay, in the uſe of good <hi>Means;</hi> by improper <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> and evil <hi>Medicines;</hi> by <hi>Juleping</hi> and <hi>Bliſtering,</hi> ſuch male Practice; the frequent <hi>Train</hi> of Diſeaſes, goes on gradually to the laſt; and ends with Death.</p>

            <p>How many <hi>Fevers</hi> depend upon <hi>Obſtructions;</hi> by depraved <hi>Matter</hi> lodged, and ſtopping ſome <hi>Canal,</hi> or <hi>Ductare,</hi> that ought to be free and open for Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion? Very many; and very often, this is the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerating</hi> Cauſe and this is the <hi>continuing</hi> Cauſe: You may then give <hi>Julep,</hi> after <hi>Julep,</hi> from <hi>Day</hi> to <hi>Day;</hi> and never Cure ſuch Fevers after that manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſtructions</hi> moſt commonly cauſe <hi>Pain;</hi> this Pain raiſeth a <hi>Fever;</hi> and ſometimes an <hi>Inflammation,</hi> in the <hi>Part</hi> pained: This <hi>Inflammation</hi> forms a <hi>Tumor; internal</hi> and not perceived, or ſuſpected.

            <p>After this manner, ſo many <hi>Thouſands</hi> have died of <hi>Fevers,</hi> or rather in <hi>Fevers;</hi> by the Ignorance and great Miſtakes, of the Pretenders to Cure <hi>Fevers,</hi> which they underſtand not.</p>
            <p>Such Caſes of <hi>internal Tumors,</hi> and <hi>Inflammations;</hi> come oftner into the <hi>Phyſicians</hi> Practice, than taken notice of; and <hi>Thouſands</hi> have <hi>died</hi> upon this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; when the true ſtate of the Caſe was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned: But the Patient <hi>died</hi> of a <hi>Fever;</hi> the <hi>Fever</hi> was apparent and aimed at; the reſt was <hi>latent,</hi> and therefore proved <hi>mortal.</hi>

And this firſt <hi>Diviſion</hi> of ſuppoſed Diſeaſes; hath made more Buſtle, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>febrile</hi> Diſtemper the chief) and ſo engroſſed the <hi>Practice</hi> of Phyſick, that moſt endeavours have vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been ſpent thereupon; much <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> loſt; the conſiderable and moſt important <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes</hi> overſeen; and the frequent Progreſs of this dangerous <hi>Train,</hi> ſo ſeldom under Conſideration, in <hi>Conſultation;</hi> being <hi>Mask'd</hi> and <hi>Covered;</hi> with the external Appearance, and outſide <hi>Garb</hi> of a <hi>Sympto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> Fever; which <hi>miſtake</hi> and overſight, hath loſt <hi>Myriads</hi> of Lives.</p>
            <p>The Proceeding and <hi>Advance</hi> of this dangerous <hi>Commutation,</hi> being frequent, and diſguiſed under <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> the cooling Inventions of <hi>Juleps, Barly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water,</hi> &amp;c. againſt <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, are very pernicious upon the Account of this <hi>latent Series</hi> of Diſeaſes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be ſuſpected: But at beſt, and in other <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voriſh</hi> Caſes; thoſe <hi>Coolers</hi> are a great <hi>delay</hi> in Curing of any <hi>Fever:</hi> yet after all this <hi>trifling,</hi> and <hi>Hazard;</hi> if the <hi>Patient</hi> eſcapes, (by good <hi>Providence</hi> only) the <hi>Doctor</hi> is applauded for bringing them out of a tedious and dangerous Sickneſs; tho' <hi>long</hi> and <hi>hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous</hi> of his own making, by a <hi>refrigerating</hi> Mode of Practice.</p>
            <pb n="129" facs="tcp:33858:70"/>
            <p>And although the <hi>Patient</hi> eſcapes the <hi>Fever,</hi> and wades through that <hi>Sickneſs;</hi> yet by ſuch male Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, they fall into <hi>Dropſies, Scurvey, Jaundice, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chectic.</hi> Habits of Body; an obſtructed tumefied <hi>Spleen, Liver, Meſentery,</hi> &amp;c. or it breaks out upon the <hi>Skin</hi> afterwards; or ſettles in a <hi>Limb,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables the Part.</p>
            <p>And it is but rational to expect ſuch <hi>Effects,</hi> from ſuch <hi>injurious</hi> ways of Curing: For; the <hi>morbific</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which cauſed the <hi>Fever,</hi> being <hi>fixed</hi> and <hi>retained,</hi> by checking and cooling the febrile <hi>Fermentation;</hi> and not obſerving the <hi>Aphoriſm, quò Natura vergit,</hi> this <hi>Morbous</hi> Impurity muſt precipitate, and ſettle in ſome <hi>Part:</hi> Then an after-game is to be played; and probably more difficult, than that of the <hi>Fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But oftentimes, the <hi>Event,</hi> and <hi>Effect</hi> of this Cooling Practice, proves <hi>fatal;</hi> and a Diſcovery, with Conviction of ſuch erroneous and dangerous Proceedings; is by <hi>Diſſection</hi> after Death, and plain Demonſtration to the Eye: As when the Phyſician <hi>dubiouſly,</hi> giving in an Account of the <hi>Sickneſs;</hi> and the <hi>Relations</hi> are not therewith ſatisfied, concerning the <hi>Death</hi> of the Patient: <hi>Diſſection</hi> then is appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; which lays open (when too late) and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents to view; an <hi>Apoſtem, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lcer,</hi> or <hi>putrid</hi> decay of ſome <hi>internal</hi> Part, <hi>Gangren'd</hi> or <hi>Mortified;</hi> which makes evident, what before was little thought of.</p>
            <p>But upon this Diſcovery of <hi>Miſcarriage;</hi> by great Miſtakes in the gradual <hi>Progreſs</hi> of the Sickneſs; and improper <hi>Deſigning</hi> of Medicines, aiming only, or
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:33858:71"/>chiefly at the <hi>Fever:</hi> Indemnification is thus contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and framed, with <hi>à ſalvo judicio:</hi> When the <hi>Corps</hi> bears any of theſe <hi>Characters;</hi> the Account is given; that the <hi>Patient</hi> was in ſuch a <hi>deſperate</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; as it was impoſſible to retrieve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover.</p>
            <p>After this <hi>manner,</hi> by ſuch <hi>Inventions,</hi> the <hi>Ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh</hi> is wip'd off the <hi>Phyſician;</hi> and he paſſes never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, for an able <hi>judicious</hi> Practiſer as before: When indeed this <hi>funeral</hi> Concluſion was brought about, for want of a true <hi>Notion,</hi> and due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this latent, and frequent Progreſs of Diſeaſes; which might have been prevented; or timely ſtopt in their courſe of Tranſition and Commutation; if the Deſign of Cure had look'd that way, to obviate the Danger ſecretly coming on.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Fever;</hi> this <hi>ignis fatuus</hi> leads all out of the right way of Curing: Oh, the <hi>Fever</hi> is very high, <hi>(Sulphur accenſum in Corde)</hi> this Bugbear ſcares them all, not knowing what evil Thing it is; (<hi>&amp; deflagratum,</hi> ſays Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>) the Sick Patient is ſet on Fire: Then to quenching and cooling as faſt as they can; for there is no <hi>enſuring</hi> Office to make good the Damage. Now here is Subject enough for <hi>Satyr,</hi> or <hi>Ridicule;</hi> but I ſhall not proſecute in ſuch Manner.</p>
            <p>The Practice upon <hi>Fevers</hi> cannot be hopeful and helpful; for as much as, the <hi>Methods</hi> and <hi>Medicines</hi> for Curing, are deſigned by a falſe <hi>Canon,</hi> of healing by contraries, <hi>(Contrariorum contraria ſunt remedia)</hi> which is the quite contrary way for Curing; then the whole proceeding is an Accumulation of Errours.</p>
            <pb n="131" facs="tcp:33858:71"/>
            <p>Let us examine the Practice in <hi>Fevers</hi> by that Rule: <hi>Fevers</hi> are hot, therefore (you ſay) they are to be Cured by <hi>Coolers,</hi> which are contraries; as the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> appoints: herein I differ from other Practiſers; they endeavor to Cool with <hi>Contraries;</hi> I Cool and Cure with <hi>Similars.</hi> They go about to Cool <hi>Fevers</hi> with <hi>Juleps, Ptiſans, Emulſions,</hi> &amp;c. and they go a great way about. I Cool and Cure with <hi>hot</hi> Liquors and <hi>Spirits;</hi> which is the ready way.</p>
            <p>But here is the Miſtake which cauſeth the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: They ſuppoſe <hi>Heat</hi> to be the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> in <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;</hi> and I look upon <hi>Heat</hi> as a <hi>Symptom,</hi> and <hi>Signal</hi> only. They apply to <hi>Symptoms</hi> depending; I level at <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> producing, and continuing them; valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not the <hi>Heat</hi> of <hi>Fevers;</hi> but am very ſolicitous to find out, and have a careful Eye, upon the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> that cauſeth the <hi>Fever:</hi> Curing lyes <hi>there,</hi> and there <hi>only;</hi> the depending <hi>Fever</hi> is included therein, and falls of courſe.</p>
            <p>Since <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, does not ariſe from any <hi>Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> Matter, (as before-proved) but from various other <hi>Material</hi> Cauſes, not <hi>inflammable;</hi> but provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the vital <hi>Spirit</hi> the <hi>Life,</hi> to aeſtuate and become hot preternaturally; which <hi>Heat</hi> riſeth and falls, as <hi>morbous</hi> Cauſes are intended and remitted.</p>
            <p>What are now the <hi>Curative</hi> Intentions, to be aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at in all <hi>Fevers?</hi> but only to remove thoſe ſeveral <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> which incenſe the governing vital Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, to exceed its bounds of natural Temper and Moderation: Level at, and overcome the <hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> the <hi>Fever</hi> then is gone alſo. <hi>Sublata causa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, tollitur ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:33858:72"/>
            <p>But what Probability, or Reaſon is there, for ſuch <hi>Coolers</hi> to Cure any <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> that produce <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers?</hi> for whether it be <hi>Obſtruction</hi> in any Part; or oppreſſion at the <hi>Stomach,</hi> by undigeſted, degenerate, or diſcordant matter; or by <hi>Wind</hi> and <hi>Flatulency;</hi> by any exotic generation, as <hi>Worms, Stones,</hi> &amp;c. any <hi>Tumor</hi> or <hi>Apoſtem</hi> breeding; <hi>Inflammation,</hi> or <hi>

            <p>But thoſe <hi>Coolers,</hi> ſtand in Oppoſition, and act re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to ſuch Medicinal <hi>Properties;</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the <hi>Cures</hi> of thoſe Infirmities: By <hi>obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of <hi>Ductures,</hi> and the <hi>Pores; incraſſating</hi> what ſhould be <hi>attenuated; coagulating</hi> what ſhould be kept <hi>fluid; condenſing</hi> what ought to be <hi>rarified</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed; <hi>fixing</hi> and retaining, what ſhould be moved and ſent away; impeding <hi>Tranſpiration,</hi> and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Putrefaction:</hi> generally, they check and damp the Power of <hi>Nature,</hi> endeavouring to extricate and quit her ſelf, from thoſe Incumbrances, and growing Evils, that aſſault and oppreſs her.</p>
            <p>In what Caſe ſoever; a <hi>Fever</hi> or vehement Heat ſhall ariſe, with ebullition and preternatural Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Blood;</hi> Cooling <hi>Medicines</hi> are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial, in many Caſes mortal; for whether it be a malign <hi>miaſm,</hi> ſeminary, or taint; or other Impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Feculency of the <hi>Blood,</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> intends
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:33858:72"/>by this <hi>febrile</hi> diſturbance and general <hi>Aeſtuation,</hi> to ſeparate and throw off; which Nature ſometimes, without any Medicinal Help does perform, and makes a good <hi>Criſis:</hi> But theſe <hi>Coolers</hi> act counter to ſuch Intentions, and prevents <hi>Natures</hi> intended good work; checking the <hi>Fermentation,</hi> and thereby hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſeparation of any depraved or noxious Admixture.</p>
            <p>And the Reaſon of theſe ill Conſequents from <hi>Cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Medicines, does chiefly lye here: Since the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> doth preſide over, and hath great Influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubſequent <hi>Digeſtions,</hi> and all other <hi>Faculties,</hi> whoſe vigorous and true performance depend much thereon; ſo that whatever ſubverts the <hi>Tone</hi> of the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and flats the acuteneſs of this principal <hi>Part,</hi> and prime office of Digeſtion (as <hi>Juleps,</hi> &amp;c. do) injures, allays and abates the energy of the reſt; impedes the <hi>Fermentation</hi> of the <hi>Bloud,</hi> for Depura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſuch Caſes; as alſo for conſervation and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply in the conſtant daily work.</p>
            <p>It may be objected and ſaid; that <hi>Lemons</hi> and <hi>Oranges</hi> are uſed in <hi>Fevers</hi> with good effects from their cooling: I anſwer, that <hi>Lemons, Oranges, Barber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and ſuch like, are allowable in <hi>Fevers</hi> as proper and fit to be uſed; but what Benefit ariſeth from them, is not to be aſcribed to their <hi>cooling</hi> virtue (if any ſuch <hi>per ſe</hi>) but only to their <hi>Acidity,</hi> which acuates and ſharpens the <hi>Ferment</hi> of the <hi>Stomach;</hi> by whoſe reinforcement, and ſtrength regained by this means; the whole Body is refreſhed, fares the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſome allay; at leaſt more Ability to bear the <hi>febrile</hi> Heat, and to contend with the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> that occaſions the <hi>Fever.</hi>

            <p>Wherefore ſuch <hi>fruits,</hi> and ſuch <hi>liquors</hi> are to be granted the Patient for Refreſhment and Support, as are moſt agreeable to the <hi>Stomach,</hi> and deſired by the Sick: And the Dictates, or Appetitions of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> in theſe Caſes, are to be regarded; who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times prompts for her own Help and Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And generally 'tis obſerved, the Drinks ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired by them, are <hi>fermented</hi> Liquors (no <hi>Juleps,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>Beer, Ale, Cider,</hi> or <hi>Wine:</hi> And commonly ſuch are moſt agreeable to the Stomach in <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> as was moſt acceptable in <hi>Health;</hi> which being diſcreetly uſed, are no Promoters nor Continuers of the <hi>Fever;</hi> tho' they be <hi>ſpirituous</hi> and brisk upon the Palate; yet beneficial and great Relief to the Sick: But always to impoſe <hi>medical</hi> Drinks, upon weak ſick People, as if they were to be nouriſhed, and live by <hi>Phyſick</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; is very irrational and abſurd.</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell you, wherein I differ from other Phyſicians, when I allow Patients cooling Drinks; as <hi>Whey, Buttermilk, Cider, Meath,</hi> when deſired in <hi>Fevers,</hi> or hot Bodies: They lay a ſtreſs upon <hi>Coolers,</hi> as <hi>Curative</hi> and principal Means againſt <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and hot <hi>Bodies,</hi> thereby to reduce the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: I allow them, not as <hi>Phyſick</hi> againſt the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but as <hi>Refreſhment</hi> to <hi>Nature,</hi> being coveted and pleaſed therewith: So that I do not impoſe as of Neceſſity; becauſe they Cure not the Diſeaſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Fever</hi> depends; but obſerving the <hi>Propriety</hi> of ſome <hi>Bodies,</hi> being delighted and comforted with ſuch liquors, I readily grant them, unleſs there be a <hi>contraindication</hi> that forbids.</p>
            <pb n="135" facs="tcp:33858:73"/>
            <p>A labouring Man that toils and heats himſelf, muſt have drink to quench his thirſt and refreſh him; and requires more Drink than another Perſon: even ſo it is with a Man in a <hi>Fever;</hi> he labours under a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi> to remove it; and he is then more thirſty, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring more <hi>Drink</hi> than at another Time: And it muſt be ſuch as delights him, that Nature does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; not <hi>Barley</hi> Water, <hi>Juleps</hi> of <hi>Still'd</hi> Waters and <hi>Syrups;</hi> ſuch ſlops that the Patient is averſe to, and gives no ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>Keep a labouring Man with <hi>Julep,</hi> and <hi>Barley</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and ſee how long he will keep his Stomach, and keep his Strength, to be able for work: He will not hold it out long, in good condition, and ability for Service. Obſerve then; if theſe <hi>Drinks</hi> ſhall make a <hi>well</hi> Man, and a <hi>ſtrong</hi> Man decline; if they pluck him down; you cannot in Reaſon expect, they can be helpful to raiſe up a weak ſick Man, to Health and Strength.</p>
            <p>All this conſidered it plainly appears; that from what Cauſe ſoever a <hi>Fever</hi> doth ariſe; this <hi>Juleping</hi> and <hi>Cooling</hi> Mode of Practice, is <hi>dangerous</hi> more or leſs, as the Diſeaſe is in its ſelf; whereon the <hi>Fever</hi> does depend: But in no Caſe advantageous; making <hi>acute</hi> Diſeaſes to <hi>Commute,</hi> and terminate in <hi>chronic;</hi> and lingering <hi>chronic</hi> Diſeaſes, to hold on their Courſe, and become more Contumacious.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Febrile</hi> Heat is much ſafer, and ſooner allayed with <hi>hot</hi> things, than with <hi>cold;</hi> for Coolers only, are but like the ſprinkling of <hi>Water</hi> upon <hi>Fire,</hi> which burns the fiercer for it afterwards: <hi>Coolers</hi> caſt a damp for
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:33858:74"/>the preſent; makes a ſhort ſuppreſſion of <hi>Heat,</hi> and it ſoon burſts out again: But <hi>hot</hi> Medicines that have Spirit and Life in them, do aſſiſt <hi>Nature</hi> in ejecting of the peccant Matter, which being caſt out, <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> then returns to her ſedate moderate temper: Therefore one good <hi>Sudorific</hi> Medicine, checks a <hi>Fever;</hi> better than ten <hi>Juleps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here I ſhall make ſome <hi>Obſervations</hi> uſeful in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice: Firſt, from the Denominations of <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Inflammation;</hi> what affinity there is, and near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have to each other; for from the <hi>Etymon</hi> of the words, they ſeem to import a <hi>Parity,</hi> as deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting only an extraordinary Heat: <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>But the difference lyes here: <hi>Fevers</hi> are known, and defined by preternatural <hi>Heat</hi> and efferveſcency through the whole Body. <hi>Inflammation</hi> is a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <hi>Heat</hi> of a particular <hi>Part.</hi> Hence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark; that Fevers are general and dilated <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations;</hi> Inflammations <hi>particular</hi> Fevers of a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: Thus they differ in Latitude and Extent: But withal obſerve the order of Cauſation; <hi>Inflammation</hi> commonly precedes and lays the Foundation in this or that <hi>Part;</hi> there is the <hi>fomes &amp; minera Morbi:</hi> A <hi>Fever</hi> follows upon the whole Body, cauſed by conſent from thence, and condolency.</p>
            <p>Here you may take notice, that <hi>Fevers</hi> are errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly defined by Authors; <hi>à calore praeter Naturam in Corde accenſo;</hi> aſſigning the <hi>Heart</hi> to be the <hi>focus,</hi> where febrile Heat is firſt kindled, and from whence it is maintained; when almoſt in any other <hi>Part</hi> of the Body, if an <hi>Inflammation</hi> happen there; a <hi>Fever</hi>
               <pb n="137" facs="tcp:33858:74"/>will follow, taking its Riſe from thence, not from the <hi>Heart:</hi> So that the <hi>Heart,</hi> then ſuffers <hi>Sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thically</hi> by conſent; not <hi>idiopathically</hi> and primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>Sedes Morbi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since moſt <hi>Inflammations</hi> cauſe <hi>Fevers,</hi> and <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> ſo frequent, as being the certain Conſequents of great <hi>Pain;</hi> then two things are to be noted: Firſt, that upon the appearance of a high <hi>Fever,</hi> you may ſuſpect an <hi>Inflammation</hi> couched under it; from whence as the Spring, this <hi>Fever</hi> doth ariſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, that the Cure of many <hi>Fevers</hi> ought ſo to be deſigned and managed, as reſpecting and aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly at a particular <hi>Inflammation</hi> of ſome <hi>Part,</hi> upon which the <hi>Fever</hi> doth depend: And when a <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> ariſeth upon this bottom (as often it doth) then little regard is to be had to the general <hi>Fever;</hi> but the ſtreſs of Cure, lyes upon removing the occaſional and material Cauſes of <hi>Pain</hi> and <hi>Inflammation</hi> in the particular <hi>Part,</hi> the Foundation of all the reſt; which being removed, the depending <hi>Fever</hi> falls of Courſe.</p>
            <p>Thus all our endeavours tend, to make a true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Cauſes;</hi> that when preternatural <hi>Heat</hi> does ariſe in the Body, and begets a <hi>Fever;</hi> you may know, not only what to call it, but alſo what to do; by levelling at the right Mark.</p>
            <p>And I muſt tell you alſo, how a <hi>Fever</hi> ſometimes does ariſe, and not from <hi>Inflammation</hi> of a pained Part: That is, when ſome depraved diſcordant <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> or ſome <hi>malign</hi> venenate <hi>Miaſm,</hi> is mingled or got into the Blood; <hi>Nature</hi> which is the <hi>Life,</hi> raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:33858:75"/>a preternatural Fermentation, and <hi>febrile</hi> effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſcency in the Maſs of <hi>Blood,</hi> for a <hi>Purification</hi> and Separation of this <hi>exotic</hi> Mixture; and admits of no ſedation or reſt, until that work be finiſhed.</p>
            <p>From hence you may be warned of the dangerous common Practice in <hi>Fevers,</hi> by <hi>Juleps, Barley-Water,</hi> and other ſuch like <hi>Coolers</hi> to allay the Heat; from a great Miſtake of Fevers, and from whence that Heat doth aſſurge: For, whether the Fever does depend upon a particular inflamed <hi>Part;</hi> or a general <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation</hi> of the Blood for <hi>Purification;</hi> in both Caſes of <hi>Fevers,</hi> ſuch <hi>Cooling</hi> Medicines are pernicious, and have killed <hi>thouſands:</hi> For by inſiſting ſo much upon them, and aiming to ſuppreſs the <hi>Fever</hi> by Coolers (not poſſible to be done that way) thus miſchievouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpending Time, the opportunity of Curing is loſt, and the Diſeaſe prevails.</p>
            <p>The Error of thoſe <hi>Cooling</hi> Medicines is apparent, from the inſucceſs thereof; for never was the <hi>Thirſt</hi> of a ſick Perſon ſatisfied by <hi>Juleps;</hi> but a Draught of good Drink, ſuch as the <hi>Patient</hi>'s Stomach affects; that is refreſhing and relieving.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Julops</hi> are but <hi>Cold</hi> Comfort, or rather no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to a <hi>Fevoriſh</hi> ſick Man; for thoſe <hi>Cold</hi> Medicines impoſed upon the ſick, are no <hi>Coolers</hi> in <hi>effect;</hi> and are ſo far from aſſiſting Nature to do the work ſhe is ſtrugling about; that they nauſeate and flat the <hi>Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> which ſhould vigorate and inforce the other Faculties; they damp and check the Power of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> contending with the <hi>Diſeaſe;</hi> and leave her languiſhing for Refreſhment, coveted in her natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral common <hi>Drink:</hi> Thus cheating the <hi>Patient</hi> of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:33858:75"/>that deſired aſſiſtance by <hi>Drink,</hi> which would be Comfortable.</p>
            <p>And thus much may ſuffice, to ſhew the Vanity and Inſufficiency of <hi>Juleps,</hi> and other <hi>Cooling</hi> Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to allay the Heat of <hi>Fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having now gone through the Common Practice upon <hi>Fevers;</hi> ſhewing the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Dangers</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in their Deſigns for Curing: All which ariſeth from their Miſtakes in the true <hi>Notion</hi> of Fevers, not knowing what they are, and from what <hi>Principle</hi> they proceed. It remains now, that I ſet forth the direct Ways, and due Means for effecting their Cures; which will appear more plainly and probably Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, being compared with the common irrational <hi>Practice,</hi> grounded upon falſe <hi>Notions</hi> of <hi>Fevers,</hi> wholly miſtaken.</p>

            </head>
            <p>IN the firſt place, I ſhall ſet before you the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Prctaice</hi> upon <hi>Fevers;</hi> and take the Account thereof from <hi>Riverius</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Author of great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; much conſulted with, and followed by moſt <hi>Practiſers:</hi> He having Collected from the beſt <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> what is moſt remarkable, and thought moſt uſeful for Curing; ſo that in his <hi>Praxis</hi> you have the <hi>Methods,</hi> and chief Matter of all the reſt. And his Book being furniſhed with variety of Medicines, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are inquiſitive after <hi>Phyſick</hi> do peruſe and eſteem that Book.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here only take notice, and curſorily view the great <hi>Magazine</hi> of Medicines, diſpoſed under the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Diviſions</hi> of Fevers; as properly and neceſſarily aſſigned, to anſwer all the <hi>Indications</hi> of thoſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Fevers,</hi> variouſly. <hi>denominated,</hi> and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; as Diſeaſes requiring <hi>different</hi> Methods, and <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Remedies.</p>
            <p>But how unneceſſary, improper, and injurious, moſt of that <hi>trouble</hi> and <hi>charge</hi> of Medicines will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, upon inquiry into the Nature and Vanity of them: As alſo by comparing with our <hi>Deſign</hi> of <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring;</hi> which is performed with very little.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:33858:76"/>
            <p>In putrid Continual <hi>Fevers,</hi> (ſo called) he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds thus: <hi>Bleeding</hi> is appointed two or three Times moſt commonly. If good <hi>Blood</hi> firſt appears; you muſt continue to take away, until the <hi>putrid</hi> bad <hi>Blood</hi> comes; and then diminiſh that: But if bad corrupt <hi>Blood</hi> comes forth firſt; you muſt continue letting out, until it appears good. All which is ſo <hi>abſurd</hi> and <hi>ridiculous;</hi> that I ſhall not ſpend Time to expoſe the folly, but refer you to what hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>And if <hi>Bleeding</hi> be not thought fit; then <hi>Cupping</hi> with <hi>Scarification,</hi> is to ſupply that Place. This is like the reſt.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Pharmaceutic</hi> Remedies, are all compriſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe two Heads: <hi>Evacuating,</hi> and <hi>Alteratives.</hi> Under the firſt, are comprehended <hi>Purges, Vomits, Sweating</hi> Medicines, and provokers of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Purgatives are <hi>Caſſia, Manna, Tamarinds, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic</hi> Electuary, <hi>Lenitive</hi> Electuary, Electuary <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prunes,</hi> Syrup of <hi>Roſes,</hi> Syrup of <hi>Cichory</hi> with <hi>Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb,</hi> &amp;c. and theſe are variouſly compounded, and made into <hi>Potions,</hi> with Still'd <hi>Waters,</hi> or <hi>Decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:</hi> Or elſe given in the form of <hi>Bolus,</hi> by adding ſome Pouders to them.</p>
            <p>They that know no better, do appoint ſuch as theſe are; and the Sick muſt ſubmit thereto: And theſe I did uſe in the beginning of my Practice, when I was a <hi>Preſcriber,</hi> (Forty Years ago) and <hi>gueſſed</hi> at Medicines, as others now do, that <hi>Preſcribe</hi> to the <hi>Shops;</hi> any thing will ſerve for a <hi>Recipe,</hi> becauſe you are to have Variety of them, and a long Courſe. But
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:33858:77"/>I have given ſufficient Information elſewhere, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Matter; that I ſhall not repeat here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Clyſters</hi> this Author appoints to be given often; <hi>every</hi> Day, or every <hi>other</hi> Day; made of Decoction of Emollients and Coolers: <hi>Barly, Prunes, Mallows, Violet</hi> leaves, <hi>Lettice, Endive, Houſleek,</hi> &amp;c. And diſſolve in the Decoction Electuary <hi>Catholicum, Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prunum, Caſſia,</hi> Oil of <hi>Water-Lillies,</hi> or <hi>Violets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Cordials many and various; which I ſhall not recite; a Glaſs of good true Wine, better than all that; and leſs to do. But to make Sickneſs <hi>charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> and <hi>hazardous;</hi> to invent much Buſineſs for the <hi>Shops,</hi> and occaſion the <hi>Phyſician</hi> to viſit often, to know the event thereof; many things are deviſed, unneceſſary, frivolous, or injurious.</p>
            <p>And he that does not promote the Trade of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick after this manner; ſhall be defamed and vilified, with the <hi>Title</hi> of <hi>Quack;</hi> and the Silly People are wheedled into a Belief, that he is no better: Tho' he be a legal Phyſician, and his knowledge much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the <hi>Preſcribing</hi> Practice. Now whether ſuch blinded, trapt ſort of Folk, are to be <hi>pitied;</hi> or <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided</hi> and <hi>ſcorn'd,</hi> when they Suffer in Sickneſs: I leave it for others to give Judgment in the Caſe.</p>
            <p>There are alſo Medicated <hi>Broths</hi> appointed, of <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Herbs,</hi> boiled with <hi>Chicken, Hen,</hi> or <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon:</hi> So that you muſt neither Eat, nor Drink, but what is <hi>Phyſick'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſame Chapter, he diſtinguiſheth <hi>Fevers</hi> into <hi>Phlegmatic, Choleric,</hi> and <hi>Melancholic;</hi> and appoints
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:33858:77"/>particularly, and differently for each. And as for <hi>Spurious</hi> Fevers (ſo termed by him) ariſing from the mixture of various Humors, the forenamed Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines are to be Compounded, with regard to the predominant <hi>Humor;</hi> that the greater Quantity be appropriated to the luxuriant prevailing Humor.</p>
            <p>All this is to make the World believe; what nice and exact <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> are framed; and Medicines formed adaptly thereto; for Curing <hi>Fevers</hi> by the beſt and moſt certain Rules of Art. But how vainly, and fallaciouſly (tho' ſpeciouſly offered) all this will appear; when I come to ſet forth, what is neceſſary in Curing all the pretended Sorts of <hi>Fevers;</hi> and with how little it may be performed; and not <hi>load</hi> a weak ſick Perſon, with a <hi>multitude</hi> of trifling ill-deſigned Medicines; under the Pretence of adapting to vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous kinds of Fevers, injuriouſly ſo feigned.</p>
            <p>Beſides all theſe <hi>internal</hi> Medicines (and I named but ſome of them) there are various <hi>external</hi> Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations appointed, to allay the heat of <hi>putrid Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:</hi> ſome are applied to the <hi>Heart;</hi> others to the Region of the <hi>Liver,</hi> the <hi>Teſticles, Hands</hi> and <hi>Feet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the <hi>Heart</hi> there are both <hi>Liquids</hi> and <hi>Solids</hi> to be applied: To the other Parts, Still'd <hi>Waters,</hi> Juices of <hi>Herbs, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nguents,</hi> and <hi>Liniments,</hi> amply ſet forth in that Chapter, where you may ſee them, if you think they are worth ſeeing.</p>
            <p>All which unneceſſary, troubleſom, and ineffectual <hi>Inventions,</hi> do proceed from want of the true Knowledge of <hi>Fevers;</hi> not diſcerning what <hi>febrile Heat</hi> is, and from what <hi>Principle</hi> it does ariſe.</p>
            <pb n="144" facs="tcp:33858:78"/>
            <p>After all this much to do upon <hi>putrid</hi> Fevers; with ſo many <hi>internal,</hi> and <hi>external</hi> Medicines; there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, as much Buſineſs with the <hi>Symptoms</hi> of putrid <hi>Fevers;</hi> and there are yet more variety of Medicines appointed for them: But I ſhall not trouble you, nor my ſelf, to give the Account of them.</p>
            <p>I always thought, and do think ſo ſtill; that true curative <hi>radical</hi> Medicines againſt any Diſeaſe; are the ſureſt <hi>Allayers,</hi> and ſafeſt <hi>Curers</hi> of Symptoms that depend upon that Diſeaſe: ſo that no peculiar Proviſion of Medicines need to be appropriated to <hi>Dependants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now all this is ſaid; we have not run through a <hi>third</hi> Part, of the Practice upon <hi>Fevers;</hi> nor na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a <hi>quarter</hi> of the <hi>Medicines:</hi> But (waving the Practice upon all the other <hi>Sorts</hi> of <hi>Fevers</hi>) here is enough to let you underſtand what the Practice of the <hi>Learned</hi> is, and hath been; this <hi>Author</hi> having ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from the reſt, and diſpoſed it into his own Method.</p>
            <p>You that like it, may make <hi>Trial</hi> thereof, when you are Sick; and then tell what it is to your Coſt, and Hazard. This was the Practice of an Eminent Doctor to the Court of <hi>France:</hi> And the Practice in other <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Princes,</hi> is much-what like this. The <hi>Preſcripts</hi> from <hi>Conſultations</hi> are no better; and ſome are worſe.</p>
            <p>The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath been treated no better by his Phyſicians; elſe he had not lingered ſo long, nor relaps'd ſo often into his <hi>Fevoriſh</hi> Diſtemper:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:33858:78"/>but endeavouring to Cure they know not <hi>what;</hi> it may in Time perchance be done: but none can ſay when; probably and rationally from ſuch Doings.</p>
            <p>This Great <hi>Prince,</hi> has great Phyſicians about him, for He made them ſo: But if they were as <hi>good,</hi> as <hi>great;</hi> they would have done better for Him.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed you the Common <hi>Practice</hi> of others upon <hi>Fevers;</hi> now I muſt give you an Account of my own, and then you may compare them.</p>
            <p>There are three principal <hi>Evacuations</hi> appointed by Nature, to ſend off, and free the Body, from all ſuperfluous unſerviceable Matter, the <hi>Relicts</hi> after Digeſtion: And this uſeleſs or offenſive Matter, goes out by three ſeveral and different ways; by the <hi>Guts</hi> downwards, by the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rinary Ductures,</hi> and by the <hi>Pores</hi> outwards to the Circumference.</p>
            <p>When there is a Failure, or inſufficient Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of theſe daily <hi>Operations,</hi> by the Debility of <hi>Nature;</hi> or by <hi>Food</hi> received unfitly in <hi>Quantity,</hi> or <hi>Quality;</hi> or other <hi>Impediments</hi> that may obſtruct, or pervert theſe neceſſary grand Operations, from cleanſing and carrying away all excrementitious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, injurious Matter, which ought to be ſent forth: The remainders lodged here, or there, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting any <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Body;</hi> does breed all the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> which produce ſeveral <hi>Fevers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This premiſed as certain and true: The Curing of all <hi>Fevers</hi> lye fair and open before you; for they are performed by promoting the three grand <hi>Evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> named: <hi>viz.</hi> by <hi>Stool,</hi> by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine,</hi> and by <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration;</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:33858:79"/>whereby the Body is cleanſed and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, from all indigeſted and degenerate <hi>Humoral</hi> Matter, or <hi>Miaſm;</hi> that breed thoſe Diſeaſes, upon which <hi>Symptomatical</hi> Fevers do depend.</p>
            <p>The Curing of all <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> after this Manner; is alſo the Curing of all <hi>Fevers,</hi> which are only <hi>Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants</hi> thereon: And there is no other and true way; but by the <hi>Operations</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>It remains now, that I aſſign the Means, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form truly and effectually, thoſe neceſſary <hi>Curative</hi> Operations: And they are only theſe two Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive <hi>Medicines,</hi> univerſal in their <hi>Claſſes.</hi> A Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic <hi>purifying Extract;</hi> and a <hi>Sudorific.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The purifying <hi>Extract</hi> operates by <hi>Stool,</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rine;</hi> ſending forth by theſe <hi>Canals</hi> of Emiſſion; all morbific vitious Matter, that muſt paſs thoſe ways, opens <hi>Obſtructions</hi> of the <hi>Spleen, Liver, Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas, Meſentery, Kidneys,</hi> &amp;c. of which more at large, in a peculiar Tract upon this great Medicine. <hi>The Myſtery of Curing Comprehenſively,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sudorific</hi> Medicine opens all the Pores, to breathe out Impurities that infeſt the <hi>Habit</hi> of Body, and external Parts: Clears and takes away all Cutany Defoedations, <hi>Spots, Scurf, Scabs, Puſtules, Tettars, Itch,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>malignant,</hi> contagious and <hi>peſtilential</hi> Fevers; as <hi>Small-Pox, Meaſels, Plague, Spotted Fevers,</hi> and the like; I account this Medicine moſt Neceſſary and Powerful.</p>
            <pb n="147" facs="tcp:33858:79"/>
            <p>Theſe are the ſafe and ſureſt ways of Curing; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ways of <hi>Nature's</hi> Inſtitution. Let the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bific Matter be as various, and different in ſeveral Perſons, as you can find out, or form a peculiar Name for: Let it be lodged and fixed here, and there, in any Part of the Body; or if it be moving and <hi>erratic,</hi> troubling many Parts, at Times: one of theſe two Medicines, or both by Turns in a Method and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; will ſend forth the offending Matter, and clear the Body, whether the <hi>Fever</hi> be continual or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, malignant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of what ſort ſoever.</p>
            <p>I have heard of intermitting Fevers (called <hi>Agues</hi>) of a Year, or two Years continuance under the uſe of Means; but I never yet was ſo baffled with any <hi>Ague.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will ingage to Cure more <hi>Fevers</hi> with theſe two Medicines only; than any of you ſhall with the two <hi>hundred</hi> Medicines appointed by <hi>Riverius,</hi> in his Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice upon <hi>Fevers:</hi> And you ſhall have the Liberty, to uſe as many more, pickt out of other <hi>Authors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mine are no <hi>Book</hi> Medicines recommended by <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,</hi> and taken up upon Truſt (as they do from one another) I like 'em not: But I depend upon my own Labour and Experience; what I have form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reformed, and proved often.</p>
            <p>Moſt People are pleaſed with a <hi>Book</hi> ſtuft full of <hi>Medicines;</hi> for this, and for that, and for hundreds of Diſeaſes: And they rove amongſt them uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; venture upon them unſafely; and moſt commonly unſucceſsfully. Very probable it ſhould be ſo; for
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:33858:80"/>they promiſe very little, to Him that underſtands the deſigning and forming of true Serviceable and Safe Medicines.</p>
            <p>Now Judge you; if two Extraordinary Medicines thus deſigned, and proved to work through all Parts of the Body, by Cleanſing and Purifying both the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, and nutritious Juices; are not more hopeful, leſs troubleſom, or chargeable; than two <hi>hundred</hi> ill-compoſed, uncertain Medicines.</p>
            <p>The two Medicines Propoſed (Catholic in their Claſſes) Cure manifeſtly; that is, by known ways and out-lets; ſuch as Nature hath framed, for ordinary daily uſe; and for extraordinary occaſions, in Sickneſs and Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>I cannot believe a <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> is gone; except I ſee, or know, which way, and how it went. There are Medicines to Charm <hi>Agues,</hi> and other Diſeaſes; ſuch as <hi>Jeſuits Pouder,</hi> and many more of that kind; but I cannot confide in ſuch Cures.</p>
            <p>I call it <hi>Charming;</hi> when a Medicine ſtops the Courſe of a Diſeaſe, ſuppreſſeth the <hi>Inſults</hi> or <hi>Fits;</hi> and you know not which way, or how the morbific Matter went; but you may rather ſuppoſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains: For, the Medicine made no manifeſt Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, or Evacuation this way, or that way; ſo that the Diſeaſe is only laid aſleep for a Time, and will wake again, and appear in its former Shape; or be transformed into ſome other Diſeaſe, that may prove as troubleſom a <hi>Gueſt,</hi> or worſe than the <hi>Ague.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="149" facs="tcp:33858:80"/>
            <p>For, <hi>morbous</hi> Matter, the longer it continues in the Body, it grows worſe, and not better. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of this Nature we frequently meet with; of changing one Diſeaſe for another: They were Cured of their <hi>Ague;</hi> but the <hi>Scurvey, Dropſy, Tumor</hi> in the <hi>Bowels,</hi> or tumified <hi>Legs,</hi> &amp;c. was the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and the proper effect of a fallacious bad way of Curing.</p>
            <p>The Curing of <hi>Fevers,</hi> is the Curing of all <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,</hi> upon which Fevers do depend; for they are only <hi>Symptoms</hi> thereof: And no Diſeaſe of what De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination ſoever; but requires ſuch Operations for Cure, as theſe two Medicines do perform; either of the one, or of both.</p>
            <p>You regard the <hi>Names</hi> of Diſeaſes, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the World: I conſider only the <hi>Nature</hi> of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in their <hi>material</hi> Cauſes, and from whence they ariſe. If you multiply Diſeaſes <hi>Circumſtantially</hi> by various <hi>Names,</hi> and make a Thouſand more than now are; yet in Curing you are confined to the ſame Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</p>
            <p>Whatever the <hi>Matter</hi> of Diſeaſes is, tho' various by <hi>Name,</hi> or <hi>Nature;</hi> the manner of ſending it away is not ſo different a Way; but by the Common known ways of Nature's Inſtitution, and they are very few, as before named.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Purifying</hi> is a <hi>Catholic</hi> Operation, required in the Cure of all Diſeaſes, by what various Names ſoever <hi>Circumſtantially</hi> denominated and diſtinguiſhed: And if that neceſſary Work will be done by <hi>one,</hi> or
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:33858:81"/>
               <hi>two</hi> Medicines extraordinarily performing: better it is, than by two <hi>Hundred</hi> of the Common Medicines, of mean Performance; if poſſible to be effected by ſuch.</p>
            <p>From hence you may underſtand, that the Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Medicines invented and diſpers'd abroad in the World; do keep the People Doing; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to their undoing; venturing upon they know not what; proved by they know not whom.</p>
            <p>Curing lies in a <hi>little</hi> compaſs, if it can be done; and by a <hi>little</hi> of <hi>radical</hi> true Medicine, more likely to be done; than by many ill-contrived, operating uncertainly at Random: wherefore doubting and miſtruſting the Ability of a <hi>few;</hi> they muſter up <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> to ſupply their Inſufficiency. <hi>(Si non juvet unum, alterum juvaturum ſperant.)</hi> If ſome miſs the Diſeaſe; the other they hope may arrive thither.</p>
            <p>In all <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>Sickneſs,</hi> the ſureſt and ſafeſt Deſign is; to aim and level, at the common and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cauſe; <hi>impure, depraved,</hi> and <hi>unſerviceable</hi> Matter, that perverts the <hi>Faculties,</hi> infeſts divers <hi>Parts,</hi> and lay the Foundation of various <hi>Infirmities:</hi> which being removed and ſent forth (by the ways aforeſaid) the great Work of <hi>Curing,</hi> is much-what performed. The remainder to be done, is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roborating and confirming the <hi>Faculties,</hi> for due performance of their <hi>Functions</hi> afterwards; to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent relapſing into the former ill State.</p>
            <p>If all <hi>Medicines</hi> had been deſigned, by the <hi>Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> that <hi>Nature</hi> performs in Human Bodies; and not formed <hi>by</hi> and <hi>to</hi> the <hi>Names</hi> of Diſeaſes: The
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:33858:81"/>whole Practice of Phyſick, had not been a <hi>quarter</hi> ſo much enlarged, as now it is; nor a <hi>tenth</hi> Part of the <hi>Medicines,</hi> ſo extravagantly invented.</p>
            <p>By what hath been ſaid; you may ſee where the <hi>ſtreſs</hi> of Curing does lie; and with how <hi>little</hi> it is to be done, if you go rightly about it: And thereby alſo you may underſtand; how unneceſſary and vain, the <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of <hi>Medicines</hi> are, in the Practice of <hi>Fevers;</hi> or other <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> where no Fevers are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending.</p>
